      "1. Prerequisites": "Before creating and using a Supplier Scorecard, it is advised that you create the following first:",
      "1. How to create Supplier Scorecard": "Go to the Supplier Scorecard list, click on New.\nSelect a Supplier to score.\nSelect the evaluating period whether weekly, monthly, or yearly.\nSetup the scoring function (details in next section).\nA supplier scorecard is created for each supplier individually. Only one supplier scorecard can be created for each supplier.",
      "2.1 Scoring Setup": "The supplier scorecard consists of a set evaluation periods, during which the performance of a supplier is evaluated. This period can be weekly, monthly or yearly. The current score is calculated from the score of each evaluation period based on the weighting function. The default formula is linearly weighed over the previous 12 scoring periods.\n\nThis formula is customizable.",
      "Supplier Standings": "The supplier standing is used to quickly sort suppliers based on their performance. These are customizable for each supplier. The scorecard standing of a supplier can also be used to restrict suppliers from being included in Request for Quotations or being issued Purchase Orders. The following screen can be seen on expanding a row in the 'Scoring Standings' table, click on the downward facing arrow.",
      "2.2 Criteria Setup": "A supplier can be evaluated on several individual evaluation criteria, including (but not limited to) quotation response time, delivered item quality, and delivery timeliness. These criteria are weighed to determine the final period score. To create a new Criteria, go to Buying > Supplier Scorecard > Supplier Scorecard Criteria: Note: Criteria weights for a scorecard should add up to 100.",
      "2.3 Supplier Scorecard Variables": "The method for calculating each criteria is determined through the Criteria Formula field, which can use a number of pre-established variables. This can be seen in the preceding screenshot. The value of each of these variables is calculated over the scoring period for each supplier. Examples of such variables include: The total number of items received from the supplier\nThe total number of accepted items from the supplier\nThe total number of rejected items from the supplier\nThe total number of d...",
      "2.4 Evaluation Formulas": "The evaluation formula uses the pre-established or custom variables to evaluate an aspect of supplier performance over the scoring period. Formulas can use the following mathematical functions: addition: +\nsubtraction: -\nmultiplication: *\ndivision: /\nmin: min(x,y)\nmax: max(x,y)\nif/else: (x) if (formula) else (y)\nless than: <\ngreater than: >\nvariables: {variable_name} It is crucial that the formula be solvable for all variable values. This is most often an issue if the value resolves to 0. For ex...",
      "2.5 Evaluating the Supplier": "An evaluation is generated for each Supplier Scorecard Period by clicking the \"Generate Missing Scorecard Periods\" button. The supplier's current score can be seen, as well as a visual graphic showing the performance of the supplier over time. Any actions against the supplier are also noted here, including warnings when creating RFQs and POs or preventing these features for this supplier altogether.",

Also if the Item's selling prices change based on Territory or due to other criteria, you can create multiple Selling Price Lists for it. On selection of Price List, its currency and applicability whether for selling/buying or both will be fetched as well.

You can change it to any UOM from the item's UOM table. For example, if Rice is sold in 1 KG and 500 grams packets, then you can mention the UOM (\"KG\" or \"grams\") in the Item Price, and the correct price will be applied based on the UOM selected in the transaction.",

      "Why use the BOM Creator?": "Users often question why a separate BOM Creator is needed to create BOMs. The answer lies in eliminating the need for unnecessary back and forth. With the standard BOM screen, users are required to create all sub-assembly BOMs first and then create the BOM for the final product. This process often involves a lot of back and forth.

Each form likes Sales Order has multiple fields like Customer, Company, etc. It also has tables like the item table, tax table, etc. In Data Import, the set of fields in the Sales Order are treated as the main table and the rows inside the child table (item table) are treated as the child table for data import. Each form in OMEX can have multiple child tables associated with it. The child tables are linked t...",
      "4.1 Import from Google Sheets": "You can also import data from Google Sheets. Import your template in Google Sheets and enter the data. Make sure the Google Sheet is public. You can test this by opening the Google Sheets URL in an incognito browser window.",
      "4.2 Submit After Import": "In OMEX document types are mainly of two types - masters and transactions. The masters are records like Customer and Task which can only be saved not submitted. Transactions like Sales Orders, Purchase Invoices are submittable documents and can be submitted. When you select a submittable document type for Import, you can tick Submit After Import to submit the document after it is imported.",
      "4.3 Don't Send Emails": "Let's say you have created a Notification in your system and whenever a Lead is created an email is sent. Now, if you are bulk importing Leads then a lot of emails will be sent, which may not be desired. You can disable this option to avoid sending emails.",
      "5.1 Upload Limit": "There is no hard limit on the number of records that can be imported. But you must try and upload only a few thousand records at a time. Importing a large number of records (let's say 50,000) might slow down the system considerably for the users that are using the system.",
      "5.2 CSV Files": "A CSV (Comma Separated Value) file is a data file that you can upload into OMEX to update various data. Any spreadsheet file from popular spreadsheet applications like MS Excel or Open Office Spreadsheet can be saved as a CSV file. If you are using Microsoft Excel and using non-English characters, make sure to save your file encoded as UTF-8. For older versions of Excel, there is no clear way of saving as UTF-8. So save your file as CSV, then open it in Notepad, then save as “UTF-8”. (Or upgr...",

For example, if you have kept the Capacity Planning For 30 days and to make 1 finished good it requires 5 days then on the current date user can only accept the 6 work orders (30/5 = 6). You can take the next Work Order when your Workstation gets free.",
      "2.1 Create Work Order With Operations": "User needs to create the Work Orders with Operations so that the system will track the Job Card timings against the Work Order. Once the user submits the Work Order, system will generate the Job Card with the available Workstation's time details. If 'Allow Overtime' is disabled in Manufacturing Settings then the system schedules the job as per the timings defined in the Workstation. If \"Allow Production on Holidays\" is disabled then the system schedules job only on working days.",
      "2.2 Workstation's Production Capacity": "In the Workstation, the user can set the 'Production Capacity'. This is the number of Operations the system will allow you work on in this Workstation. For example, if a certain Workstation can handle 10 operations at the same time, enter the 'Production Capacity' as 10.",
      "2.3 Job Card With Timing": "The system will auto-create the Job Card with timing against each operation based upon the time required to complete that operation and Workstation's availability. The user has to set the planned start date and based on the operation time, system calculates the planned end date.",

      "2.5 Capacity Planning Error": "If the Production Capacity days is less than time required to complete the operation then system throws a capacity planning error.

For manufacturing Operations and their respective Workstations are important, which can be configured based on the Finished Goods in the Bill of Materials. Warehouses are useful to store the Raw Materials and the Finished Goods. In OMEX, users can create separate Warehouse to keep Raw Materials, and Finished Goods. More details are as below: Warehouse\nWo...",
      "2. Transaction Data": "The Manufacturing module in OMEX helps you to maintain a multilevel Bill of Materials (BOMs) for your Items. It helps in product costing, production planning, creating work orders for your manufacturing shop floors, creating job cards, and planning inventory by getting your material requirements via BOMs (also called Material Requirements Planning or MRP). More details are as below: Bill Of Materials\nWork Order\nJob Card\nDisassembly Order\nProduction Plan",
      "3. Types of Production Planning": "Broadly, there are three types of Production Planning Systems: Make to Stock: In these systems, production is planned based on a forecast and the Items are then sold to distributors or customers. All fast-moving consumer goods that are sold in retail shops like soaps, packaged water, etc. and electronics like phones are made to stock.\nMake to Order: In these systems, items are manufactured only after the customer places an order of a certain number according to the customer's requirement. For ex...",
      "4. Manufacturing impact on Inventory": "Work order status is dependent upon the stock transactions made against it. In OMEX, you can transfer the raw materials required to make finished goods from Store to Work In Progress Warehouse. From Work-In-Progress warehouse the raw materials can be consumed using the Stock Entry. You get the option to either bulk consume the raw materials and add the finished good or consumed the materials first and then add the finished good.",
