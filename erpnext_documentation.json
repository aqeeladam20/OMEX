Review changes Supplier Scorecard A Supplier Scorecard is an evaluation tool used to assess the performance of suppliers. Supplier scorecards can be used to keep track of item quality, delivery, and responsiveness of suppliers across long periods of time. This data is typically used to help in purchasing decisions. A Supplier Scorecard is manually created for each supplier. To access Supplier Scorecard, go to: Home > Buying > Supplier Scorecard > Supplier Scorecard 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Supplier Scorecard, it is advised that you create the following first: Supplier 1. How to create Supplier Scorecard Go to the Supplier Scorecard list, click on New. Select a Supplier to score. Select the evaluating period whether weekly, monthly, or yearly. Setup the scoring function (details in next section). A supplier scorecard is created for each supplier individually. Only one supplier scorecard can be created for each supplier. 2. Features 2.1 Scoring Setup The supplier scorecard consists of a set evaluation periods, during which the performance of a supplier is evaluated. This period can be weekly, monthly or yearly. The current score is calculated from the score of each evaluation period based on the weighting function. The default formula is linearly weighed over the previous 12 scoring periods. This formula is customizable. Supplier Standings The supplier standing is used to quickly sort suppliers based on their performance. These are customizable for each supplier. The scorecard standing of a supplier can also be used to restrict suppliers from being included in Request for Quotations or being issued Purchase Orders. The following screen can be seen on expanding a row in the 'Scoring Standings' table, click on the downward facing arrow. 2.2 Criteria Setup A supplier can be evaluated on several individual evaluation criteria, including (but not limited to) quotation response time, delivered item quality, and delivery timeliness. These criteria are weighed to determine the final period score. To create a new Criteria, go to Buying > Supplier Scorecard > Supplier Scorecard Criteria: Note: Criteria weights for a scorecard should add up to 100. 2.3 Supplier Scorecard Variables The method for calculating each criteria is determined through the Criteria Formula field, which can use a number of pre-established variables. This can be seen in the preceding screenshot. The value of each of these variables is calculated over the scoring period for each supplier. Examples of such variables include: The total number of items received from the supplier The total number of accepted items from the supplier The total number of rejected items from the supplier The total number of deliveries from the supplier The total amount (in dollars) received from a supplier Variables are pre-set, additional variables can be added through server-side customizations. Tick the Custom checkbox if the variable you're creating is for a custom field. The criteria formula should be customized to evaluate the suppliers in each criteria in a way that best fits the company requirements. 2.4 Evaluation Formulas The evaluation formula uses the pre-established or custom variables to evaluate an aspect of supplier performance over the scoring period. Formulas can use the following mathematical functions: addition: + subtraction: - multiplication: * division: / min: min(x,y) max: max(x,y) if/else: (x) if (formula) else (y) less than: < greater than: > variables: {variable_name} It is crucial that the formula be solvable for all variable values. This is most often an issue if the value resolves to 0. For example: {total_accepted_items} / {total_received_items} This example would resolve to 0 / 0 in periods where there are no received items, and therefore should have a check to protect in this case: ({total_accepted_items} / {total_received_items}) if {total_received_items} > 0 else 1. 2.5 Evaluating the Supplier An evaluation is generated for each Supplier Scorecard Period by clicking the \"Generate Missing Scorecard Periods\" button. The supplier's current score can be seen, as well as a visual graphic showing the performance of the supplier over time. Any actions against the supplier are also noted here, including warnings when creating RFQs and POs or preventing these features for this supplier altogether. 3.

  "OMEX Purchase Order": {
    "title": "Purchase Order",
    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Purchase Order A Purchase Order is a binding contract with your Supplier that you promise to buy a set of items under given conditions. It is similar to a Sales Order but instead of sending it to an external party, you keep it for internal records. Home > Buying > Purchasing > Purchase Order 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Purchase Order, it is advised that you create the following first: Supplier Item 2. How to create a Purchase Order A Purchase Order can be automatically created from a Material Request or Supplier Quotation. Go to the Purchase Order list, click on New. Select the Supplier, required by date. In the items table, select the item by code, you can change the required by date for each item. Set the quantity and the price will be fetched automatically if set in the Item master. Set taxes. Save and Submit. 2.1 Setting Warehouses Set Target Warehouse: Optionally, you can set the default target Warehouse where the purchased Items will be delivered. This will be fetched into the Item table rows. 2.2 Fetching Items from Open Material Requests Items can be fetched into the Purchase Order automatically from open Material Requests. For this to work, the following steps need to be done: Select a Supplier in the Purchase Order. Set default Supplier in the Item form under Item Defaults. A Material Request needs to be present of type 'Purchase'. Click on the Get Items from open Material Requests button below the Supplier name. Now a dialog will appear with Material Requests containing Items for which the default Supplier is the same as the one selected in the Purchase Order. On selecting the Material Requests and clicking on Get Items, the Items will be fetched from the Material Requests. Note: The Get Items from Open Material Requests button is visible as long as the Items table is empty. 3. Features 3.1 Address and Contact Select Supplier Address: The Supplier's billing address. Select Shipping Address: The Supplier's shipping address from which they'll be sending the items. Address, Shipping Address, Contact, Contact Email will be fetched if saved in the Supplier master. For India: Supplier and Company GSTIN: The GST Identification Number of your Supplier and your company. Place of Supply: For GST, Place of Supply is necessary. It consists of the state's name and number. 3.2 Currency and Price List You can set the currency in which the purchase order is to be stored. If you set a Pricing List, then the item prices will be fetched from that list. Ticking on Ignore Pricing Rule will ignore the Pricing Rules set in Accounts > Pricing Rule. Read about Price Lists and Multi-Currency Transactions to know more. 3.3 Subcontracting or 'Supply Raw Materials' Setting 'Supply Raw Materials' option is useful for subcontracting where you provide the raw materials for manufacturing an item. To know more, visit the Subcontracting page. 3.4 The Items table Scan Barcode: You can add Items in the Items table by scanning their barcodes if you have a barcode scanner. Read documentation for tracking items using barcode to know more. Quantity and Rate: When you select the Item code, its name, description, and UOM will be fetched. The 'UOM Conversion Factor' is set to 1 by default, you can change it depending on the UOM received from the seller, more in the next section. 'Price List Rate' will be fetched if a Standard Buying rate is set. 'Last Purchase Rate' shows the rate of the item from your last Purchase Order. Rate is fetched if set in the item master. You can attach an Item Tax Template to apply a specific tax rate to the item. * Item weights will be fetched if set in the Item master else enter manually. * Warehouse: The warehouse where the items will be delivered, will be auto filled if 'Set Target Warehouse' was set in the Purchase Order. Via Blanket Order, a Blanket Order can be linked, to know more click here. A 'Project' can be linked to track progress. A 'BOM' or Bill of Materials can also be linked to track progress. * 'Qty as per Stock UOM' will show the current stock as per the UOM set in the Item master. 'Received Qty' will be updated when the items are billed. * Accounting Details: This section is auto filled for a Purchase Order. 'Expense Account' is the account against which the PO is billed, and Cost Center is the CC against which the PO is charged. A “Required By” date on each Item: If you are expecting part delivery, your Supplier will know how much quantity to deliver at which date. This will help you from preventing over-supply. It will also help you to track how well your Supplier is doing on timeliness. Allow Zero Valuation Rate: Ticking on 'Allow Zero Valuation Rate' will allow submitting the Purchase Receipt even if the Valuation Rate of the Item is 0. This can be a sample item or due to a mutual understanding with your Supplier. 3.5 Raw Materials Supplied This section appears when 'Supply Raw Materials' supplied is set to 'Yes'. This section shows a table with the Items to be supplied to the Supplier for the subcontracting process. Set Reserve Warehouse: When Subcontracting, the raw materials can be reserved in a separate Warehouse. On selecting the Reserved Warehouse here, it'll be fetched into Item rows of the Raw Materials Supplied table. Supplied Items Table Required Quantity: The count of Items required to complete the subcontracting as specified in the BOM. Supplied Quantity: This will be updated when you create Stock Entries to transfer materials to Supplier Warehouse from the Reserve Warehouse using the Transfer button. 3.6 Purchase UOM and Stock UOM Conversion You can change your UOM as per your stock requirements in the Purchase Order. For example, if you have bought your raw material in large quantities with UOM - boxes and wish to stock them in UOM - Nos; you can do so while making your Purchase Order. Store UOM as Nos in the Item master. Note that the UOM in the Item master is the stock UOM. In the Purchase Order mention UOM as Box. (Since material arrives in Boxes) In the Warehouse and Reference section, the UOM will be pulled in as Nos (from the Item form): 4. Mention the UOM conversion factor. For example, (1); If one box has 1 kilo. 5. Notice that the stock quantity will be updated accordingly. 3.7 Taxes and Charges If your Supplier is going to charge you additional taxes or charge like a shipping or insurance charge, you can add it here. It will help you to accurately track your costs. Also, if some of these charges add to the value of the product you will have to mention them in the Taxes table. Visit the Purchase Taxes and Charges Template page to know more about taxes. The total taxes and charges will be displayed below the table. To add taxes automatically via a Tax Category, visit this page. Make sure to mark all your taxes in the Taxes and Charges table correctly for an accurate valuation. Shipping Rule A Shipping Rule helps set the cost of shipping an Item. The cost will usually increase with the distance of shipping. To know more, visit the Shipping Rule page. For example, you buy Items worth X and sell them for 1.3X. So, your Customer pays 1.3 times the tax you pay your Supplier. Since you have already paid tax to your Supplier for X, what you owe your government is only the tax on 0.3X. This is very easy to track in OMEX since each tax head is also an Account. Ideally you must create two Accounts for each type of VAT you pay and collect, “Purchase VAT-X” (asset) and “Sales VAT-X” (liability), or something to that effect. 3.8 Additional Discount Other than recording discount per item, you can add a discount to the whole purchase order in this section. This discount could be based on the Grand Total i.e., post-tax/charges or Net total i.e., pre-tax/charges. The additional discount can be applied as a percentage or an amount. Read Applying Discount for more details. 3.9 Payment Terms Sometimes payment is not done all at once. Depending on the agreement, half of the payment may be made before shipment and the other half after receiving the goods/services. You can add a Payment Terms template or add the terms manually in this section. Read Payment Terms to know more. 3.10 Terms and Conditions In Sales/Purchase transactions there might be certain Terms and Conditions based on which the Supplier provides goods or services to the Customer. You can apply the Terms and Conditions to transactions to transactions and they will appear when printing the document. To know about Terms and Conditions, click here 3.11 Print Settings Letterhead You can print your request for quotation / purchase order on your company's letterhead. Know more here.

The seller's Additional Discount, Payment Terms, Terms and Conditions can be recorded in your Purchase Order. 3.12 More Information This section shows the status of the Purchase Order, percentage of items received, and percentage of items billed.

Since you have already paid tax to your Supplier for X, what you owe your government is only the tax on 0.3X. This is very easy to track in OMEX since each tax head is also an Account. Ideally you must create two Accounts for each type of VAT you pay and collect, “Purchase VAT-X” (asset) and “Sales VAT-X” (liability), or something to that effect.",
      "3.8 Additional Discount": "Other than recording discount per item, you can add a discount to the whole purchase order in this section. This discount could be based on the Grand Total i.e., post-tax/charges or Net total i.e., pre-tax/charges. The additional discount can be applied as a percentage or an amount. Read Applying Discount for more details.",
      "3.9 Payment Terms": "Sometimes payment is not done all at once. Depending on the agreement, half of the payment may be made before shipment and the other half after receiving the goods/services. You can add a Payment Terms template or add the terms manually in this section. Read Payment Terms to know more.",
      "3.10 Terms and Conditions": "In Sales/Purchase transactions there might be certain Terms and Conditions based on which the Supplier provides goods or services to the Customer. You can apply the Terms and Conditions to transactions to transactions and they will appear when printing the document. To know about Terms and Conditions, click here",
      "Letterhead": "You can print your request for quotation / purchase order on your company's letterhead. Know more here. 'Group same items' will group the same items added multiple times in the items table. This can be seen when your print.",
      "Print Headings": "Titles of your documents can be changed. Know more here. The seller's Additional Discount, Payment Terms, Terms and Conditions can be recorded in your Purchase Order.",
      "3.12 More Information": "This section shows the status of the Purchase Order, percentage of items received, and percentage of items billed. If this is an Inter-Company Order, the Sales Order can be linked here.",
      "3.13 After Submitting": "Once you “Submit” your Purchase Order, you can trigger actions these actions: You can Add, Update, Delete items in the Purchase Order by clicking on the Update Items button.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Buying Settings OMEX allows you to configure various settings and configurations that help streamline and automate the purchasing workflow. Naming Series and Price Defaults 1. Supplier Naming By When a Supplier is saved, system generates a unique identity or name for that Supplier which can be used to refer the Supplier in various Buying transactions. If not configured otherwise, OMEX uses the Supplier's Name as the unique name. If you want to identify Suppliers using names like SUPP-00001, SUPP-00002, or such other patterned series, select the value of Supplier Naming By as \"Naming Series\". 2. Default Supplier Group Configure what should be the default value of Supplier Group when creating a new Supplier. For example, if most of your suppliers supply you hardware, you can set the default as 'Hardware'. 3. Default Buying Price List Configure what should be the default Price List when creating a new Buying transaction, the default is set as 'Standard Buying'. Item prices will be fetched from this Price List. You can modify the 'Price List' by using the arrow at the right-end of the field to change the currency and country. 4. Action if Same Rate is Not Mentioned It defines the action the should take when it encounters a purchase order, material request, or any other buying transaction where the same rate of an item is not mentioned. There are two possible actions the user can take. Stop: The system will stop the transaction preventing the user from proceeding without specifying a rate. This ensures that all transactions have explicit rates mentioned, avoiding potential discrepancies. Warn: The system will allow the transaction happen but will display a warning message to alert the user that the same rate has not been mentioned. 5. Role Allowed to Override Stop Action This setting specifies which user roles have the permission to override the \"Stop\" action in the buying transaction due to discrepancy in the rate. Transaction Settings 1. Is Purchase Order Required for Purchase Invoice & Receipt Creation? If this option is configured \"Yes\", OMEX will prevent you from creating a Purchase Invoice or a Purchase Receipt directly without creating a Purchase Order first. If retail transactions are involved where the order happens offline, then Purchase Orders can be skipped. If you're accepting sample Items, you can directly create a Purchase Receipt to receive the Items to your Warehouse. This configuration can be overridden for a particular supplier by enabling the \"Allow Purchase Invoice Creation Without Purchase Order\" checkbox in supplier master 2. Is Purchase Receipt Required for Purchase Invoice Creation? If this option is configured \"Yes\", OMEX will prevent you from creating a Purchase Invoice without creating a Purchase Receipt first. In case the Item being transacted is a service, it'll not require a receipt, you can directly create an Invoice. This configuration can be overridden for a particular supplier by enabling the \"Allow Purchase Invoice Creation Without Purchase Receipt\" checkbox in the supplier master 3. Blanket Order Allowance (%) You can set the percentage you are allowed to order more against the Blanket Order Quantity. For example: If you have a Blanket Order of Quantity 100 units. and your Allowance is 10% then you are allowed to order 110 units. 4. Update frequency of Project It indicates how often should Project be updated of Total Purchase Cost. 5. Maintain Same Rate Throughout Purchase Cycle If this is enabled, OMEX will validate whether an Item's price is changing in a Purchase Invoice or Purchase Receipt created from a Purchase Order, i.e. it will help you maintain the same rate throughout the purchase cycle. You can configure the action that system should take if the same rate is not maintained in the \"Action If Same Rate is Not Maintained\" field: Stop: OMEX will stop you from changing the price by throwing a validation error. Warn: The system will let you save the transaction but warn you with a message if the rate is changed. Note: This field will only be visible if Maintain Same Rate Throughout Purchase Cycle is enabled. 6. Allow Item to be added multiple times in a transaction When this checkbox is unchecked, an item cannot be added multiple times in the same Purchase Order. However, you can still explicitly change the quantity. This is a validation checkbox for preventing accidental purchase of the same item. This can be checked for specific use cases where there are multiple sources for the same material, for example in manufacturing. 7. Bill for Rejected Quantity in Purchase Invoice If checked, Rejected Quantity will be included while making Purchase Invoice from Purchase Receipt. 7.1 Set Valuation Rate for Rejected Materials For rejected materials, the valuation rate is set to zero, and no accounting ledger entry is created for them in the Purchase Receipt. To apply a valuation rate and generate accounting entries for rejected materials, enable the 'Set Valuation Rate for Rejected Materials' option in Buying Settings. 8. Set Landed Cost Based on Purchase Invoice Rate If the 'Maintain Same Rate Throughout the Purchase Cycle' is disabled then this field shows in the buying settings. If user wants to adjust the product valuation as per the purchase invoice cost then this option needs to be enable. How It Works Created Purchase Receipt for item A with rate as 100 System has booked Stock In Hand with 100 rate After 2 days, user has created purchase invoice against the above purchase receipt After 2 days because of change in exchange rate the rate in the invoice changed to 150 Now purchase receipt has rate 100 where as Purchase invoice has rate 150 If you want to adjust the Stock In Hand with Purchase invoice Rate (150) then enable \"Set Landed Cost Based on Purchase Invoice Rate\". Note: on submission of the purchase invoice, system creates the repost item valuation record to update the cost of the purchase receipt. User has to wait to complete the repost item valuation to see the impact of the invoice cost on the stock in hand. 9. Disable Last Purchase Rate It prevents the system from automatically using the rate from the last purchase transaction when creating new purchase orders or transactions. 10. Use Transaction Date Exchange Rate While making Purchase Invoice from Purchase Order, use Exchange Rate on Invoice's transaction date rather than inheriting it from Purchase Order. Only applies for Purchase Invoice. Subcontracting Settings 1. Backflush Raw Materials of Subcontract Based On BOM: system will consume raw materials in the subcontracting receipt as per the FG BOM Material Transferred for Subcontract: system will consume raw materials based on the materials transferred against the Subcontracting Order. If no stock transferred then no materials will be consume at the time of Subcontracting Receipt. 2. Auto Create Subcontracting Order System will auto create the subcontracting order in a Draft state on submission of the purchase order which has \"Is Subcontracted\" enabled. 3. Auto Create Purchase Receipt System will auto create the purchase receipt for the service items in a Draft state on submission of the subcontracting receipt. 4. Over Transfer Allowance (%) It is the percentage you are allowed to transfer more against the quantity ordered. For example: If you have ordered 100 units. and your Allowance is 10% then you are allowed to transfer 110 units.

Set Landed Cost Based on Purchase Invoice Rate\nIf the 'Maintain Same Rate Throughout the Purchase Cycle' is disabled then this field shows in the buying settings. If user wants to adjust the product valuation as per the purchase invoice cost then this option needs to be enable.\nHow It Works\n\nCreated Purchase Receipt for item A with rate as 100\nSystem has booked Stock In Hand with 100 rate\nAfter 2 days, user has created purchase invoice against the above purchase receipt\nAfter 2 days because of change in exchange rate the rate in the invoice changed to 150\nNow purchase receipt has rate 100 where as Purchase invoice has rate 150\nIf you want to adjust the Stock In Hand with Purchase invoice Rate (150) then enable \"Set Landed Cost Based on Purchase Invoice Rate\".\n\nNote: on submission of the purchase invoice, system creates the repost item valuation record to update the cost of the purchase receipt. User has to wait to complete the repost item valuation to see the impact of the invoice cost on the stock in hand.\n9. Disable Last Purchase Rate\nIt prevents the system from automatically using the rate from the last purchase transaction when creating new purchase orders or transactions.\n10. Use Transaction Date Exchange Rate\nWhile making Purchase Invoice from Purchase Order, use Exchange Rate on Invoice's transaction date rather than inheriting it from Purchase Order. Only applies for Purchase Invoice.\nSubcontracting Settings\n \n1. Backflush Raw Materials of Subcontract Based On\n\nBOM: system will consume raw materials in the subcontracting receipt as per the FG BOM\nMaterial Transferred for Subcontract: system will consume raw materials based on the materials transferred against the Subcontracting Order. If no stock transferred then no materials will be consume at the time of Subcontracting Receipt.\n\n2. Auto Create Subcontracting Order\nSystem will auto create the subcontracting order in a Draft state on submission of the purchase order which has \"Is Subcontracted\" enabled.\n3. Auto Create Purchase Receipt\nSystem will auto create the purchase receipt for the service items in a Draft state on submission of the subcontracting receipt.\n4. Over Transfer Allowance (%)\nIt is the percentage you are allowed to transfer more against the quantity ordered. For example: If you have ordered 100 units. and your Allowance is 10% then you are allowed to transfer 110 units. OMEX allows you to configure various settings and configurations that help streamline and automate the purchasing workflow.\nNaming Series and Price Defaults\n \n1. Supplier Naming By\nWhen a Supplier is saved, system generates a unique identity or name for that Supplier which can be used to refer the Supplier in various Buying transactions.\nIf not configured otherwise, OMEX uses the Supplier's Name as the unique name. If you want to identify Suppliers using names like SUPP-00001, SUPP-00002, or such other patterned series, select the value of Supplier Naming By as \"Naming Series\".\n2. Default Supplier Group\nConfigure what should be the default value of Supplier Group when creating a new Supplier. For example, if most of your suppliers supply you hardware, you can set the default as 'Hardware'.\n3. Default Buying Price List\nConfigure what should be the default Price List when creating a new Buying transaction, the default is set as 'Standard Buying'. Item prices will be fetched from this Price List. You can modify the 'Price List' by using the arrow at the right-end of the field to change the currency and country.\n4. Action if Same Rate is Not Mentioned\nIt defines the action the should take when it encounters a purchase order, material request, or any other buying transaction where the same rate of an item is not mentioned.\nThere are two possible actions the user can take.\n\nStop: The system will stop the transaction preventing the user from proceeding without specifying a rate. This ensures that all transactions have explicit rates mentioned, avoiding potential discrepancies.\nWarn: The system will allow the transaction happen but will display a warning message to alert the user that the same rate has not been mentioned.\n\n5. Role Allowed to Override Stop Action\nThis setting specifies which user roles have the permission to override the \"Stop\" action in the buying transaction due to discrepancy in the rate.\nTransaction Settings\n \n1. Is Purchase Order Required for Purchase Invoice & Receipt Creation?\nIf this option is configured \"Yes\", OMEX will prevent you from creating a Purchase Invoice or a Purchase Receipt directly without creating a Purchase Order first.\nIf retail transactions are involved where the order happens offline, then Purchase Orders can be skipped. If you're accepting sample Items, you can directly create a Purchase Receipt to receive the Items to your Warehouse.\nThis configuration can be overridden for a particular supplier by enabling the \"Allow Purchase Invoice Creation Without Purchase Order\" checkbox in supplier master\n2. Is Purchase Receipt Required for Purchase Invoice Creation?\nIf this option is configured \"Yes\", OMEX will prevent you from creating a Purchase Invoice without creating a Purchase Receipt first. In case the Item being transacted is a service, it'll not require a receipt, you can directly create an Invoice.\nThis configuration can be overridden for a particular supplier by enabling the \"Allow Purchase Invoice Creation Without Purchase Receipt\" checkbox in the supplier master\n3. Blanket Order Allowance (%)\nYou can set the percentage you are allowed to order more against the Blanket Order Quantity. For example: If you have a Blanket Order of Quantity 100 units. and your Allowance is 10% then you are allowed to order 110 units.\n4. Update frequency of Project\nIt indicates how often should Project be updated of Total Purchase Cost.\n5. Maintain Same Rate Throughout Purchase Cycle\nIf this is enabled, OMEX will validate whether an Item's price is changing in a Purchase Invoice or Purchase Receipt created from a Purchase Order, i.e. it will help you maintain the same rate throughout the purchase cycle.\nYou can configure the action that system should take if the same rate is not maintained in the \"Action If Same Rate is Not Maintained\" field:\n\nStop: OMEX will stop you from changing the price by throwing a validation error.\nWarn: The system will let you save the transaction but warn you with a message if the rate is changed.\n\nNote: This field will only be visible if Maintain Same Rate Throughout Purchase Cycle is enabled.\n6. Allow Item to be added multiple times in a transaction\nWhen this checkbox is unchecked, an item cannot be added multiple times in the same Purchase Order. However, you can still explicitly change the quantity. This is a validation checkbox for preventing accidental purchase of the same item. This can be checked for specific use cases where there are multiple sources for the same material, for example in manufacturing.\n7. Bill for Rejected Quantity in Purchase Invoice\nIf checked, Rejected Quantity will be included while making Purchase Invoice from Purchase Receipt.  \n8.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Purchase Invoice A Purchase Invoice is a bill you receive from your Suppliers against which you need to make the payment. Purchase Invoice is the exact opposite of your Sales Invoice. Here you accrue expenses to your Supplier. Making a Purchase Invoice is very similar to making a Purchase Order. To access the Purchase Invoice list, go to: Home > Accounting > Accounts Payable > Purchase Invoice 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Purchase Invoice, it is advised to create the following first: Item Supplier Purchase Order Purchase Receipt (optional) 2. How to create a Purchase Invoice: A Purchase Invoice is usually created from a Purchase Order or a Purchase Receipt. The Supplier's Item details will be fetched into the Purchase Invoice. However, you can also create a Purchase Invoice directly. To fetch the details automatically in a Purchase Invoice, click on the Get Items from. The details can be fetched from a Purchase Order or Purchase Receipt. For manual creation, follow these steps: Go to the Purchase Invoice list, click on New. Select the Supplier. The posting date and time will be set to current, you can edit after you tick the checkbox below Posting Time. Set the Due Date for payment. Add Items and quantities in the Items table. The Rate and Amount will be fetched. Save and Submit. 2.1 Additional options when creating a Purchase Invoice Is Paid: You can tick 'Is Paid' if the amount has already been paid via an Advance Payment Entry. This should be ticked if there is full or partial payment. Is Return (Debit Note): Tick this if the customer has returned the Items. To know more details, visit the Debit Note page. Apply Tax Withholding Amount: If the selected Supplier has a Tax Withholding Category set, this checkbox will be enabled. For more information, visit the Tax Withholding Category page. 2.2 Statuses Draft: A draft is saved but yet to be submitted to the system. Return: The Items have been returned to the Supplier. Debit Note Issued: The Items have been returned and a Debit Note has been issued against the invoice. Submitted: The Purchase Invoice has been submitted to the system and the general ledger has been updated. Paid: Supplier has been fully paid the invoice amount and the corresponding Payment Entries have been submitted. Partly Paid: Supplier has been paid a part of the invoice amount and the corresponding Payment Entries have been submitted. Unpaid: The Purchase Invoice is yet to be paid. Overdue: The due date has passed for payment. Canceled: The invoice has been canceled due to some reason. 3.

More 4.1 Accounting Impact Similar to a Sales Invoice, in a Purchase Invoice you have to enter an Expense or an Asset account for each row in your Items table. This helps to indicate if the Item is an Asset or an Expense. You can also change the Cost Center. These can also be set in the Item master. The Cost Center can be set at the Company level. The Purchase Invoice will affect your accounts as follows: Accounting entries (GL Entry) for a typical double entry “purchase”: Debits: Expense or Asset (net totals, excluding taxes) Taxes (/assets if VAT-type or expense again) Credits: Supplier 4.2 Accounting When Is Paid is checked If Is Paid is checked, OMEX will also make the following accounting entries: Debits: Supplier Credits: Bank/Cash Account To see entries in your Purchase Invoice after you “Submit”, click on “View Ledger”. 4.3 Is purchase an “Expense” or an “Asset”? If the Item is consumed immediately on purchase, or if it is a service, then the purchase becomes an “Expense”. For example, a telephone bill or travel bill is an “Expense” - it is already consumed. For inventory Items, that have a value, these purchases are not yet “Expense”, because they still have a value while they remain in your stock. They are “Assets”. If they are raw-materials (used in a process), they will become “Expense” the moment they are consumed in the process. If they are to be sold to a Customer, they become “Expense” when you ship them to the Customer. 4.4 Deducting Taxes at Source In many countries, the law may require you to deduct taxes, while paying your suppliers. These taxes could be based on a standard rate. Under these type of schemes, typically if a Supplier crosses a certain threshold of payment, and if the type of product is taxable, you may have to deduct some tax (which you pay back to your government, on your Supplier’s behalf). To do this, you will have to make a new Tax Account under “Tax Liabilities” or similar and credit this Account by the percent you are bound to deduct for every transaction. 4.5 Hold Payments For A Purchase Invoice There are two ways to put a purchase invoice on hold: Date Span Hold Explicit Hold Explicit Hold Explicit hold holds the purchase invoice indefinitely. To do it, in the \"Hold Invoice\" section of the purchase invoice form, simply check the \"Hold Invoice\" checkbox. In the \"Reason For Putting On Hold\" text field, type a comment explaining why the invoice is to be put on hold. If you need to hold a submitted invoice, click the \"Make\" button and click \"Block Invoice\". Also, add a comment explaining why the invoice is to be put on hold in the dialog that pops up and click \"Save\". Date Span Hold Date span hold holds the purchase invoice until a specified date. To do it, in the \"Hold Invoice\" section of the purchase invoice form, check the \"Hold Invoice\" checkbox. Next, input the release date in the dialog that pops up and click \"Save\". The release date is the date that the hold on the document expires. After the invoice has been saved, you can change the release date by clicking on the \"Hold Invoice\" drop-down button and then \"Change Release Date\". This action will cause a dialog to appear. Select the new release date and click \"Save\". You should also enter a comment in the \"Reason For Putting On Hold\" field. Take note of the following: All purchases that have been placed on hold will not be included in a Payment Entry's references table The release date cannot be in the past. You can only block or unblock a purchase invoice if it is unpaid. You can only change the release date if the invoice is unpaid. 4.6 Provisional accounting for expenses (only for Non-Stock Items) In many situations, a service is received and the expense is incurred but the Purchase Invoicing for that service is done in the subsequent month, so this expense doesn't flow into your monthly financial statements like Profit and Loss as invoicing is still pending. Provisional Accounting helps you address this problem. Below are the steps to set up provisional accounting. Enable provisional accounting in the company master and set the default provisional account Make a Purchase Receipt for a non-stock item Accounting entries against the Purchase Receipt will be as follows Make a Purchase Invoice against the Purchase Receipt Accounting entries against the Purchase Invoice will be posted as usual On posting a purchase invoice accounting entries against the purchase receipt will be reversed 5.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Debit Note A Debit Note is a document sent by a buyer to the Supplier notifying that a debit has been recorded against the goods returned to the Supplier. A Debit Note is issued for the value of the goods returned. In some cases, sellers are seen sending Debit Notes which should be treated as like another invoice. A Debit is for your record of the debit against the Items your return. 1. How to create Debit Note The user can make a Debit Note against the Purchase Invoice or they can directly make Debit Note from the Purchase Invoice without reference. Go to the respective Purchase Invoice and click on Create > Return / Debit Note. The Supplier and Item details will be fetched as set in the Purchase Invoice. If you had paid partially or fully, make a Payment Entry against the original Purchase Invoice. Save and Submit. The other steps are similar to a Purchase Invoice. 1.1 How does Debit Note affect ledger The Debit Note will reverse the impact of the purchase invoice. Refer the Purchase Invoice page for any other details. 1.2 No payment was made against Sales Invoice In case no payment was made against the original invoice, you could just cancel the Sales Invoice. But, if only 5 out of 10 Items are being returned from an invoice, creating a Debit Note is useful for updating the ledger. 2. Example From Supplier Blue Mills, you had purchased Cotton worth Rs 2400 + taxes and at the time of delivery, you found that the products were damaged. Now you returned the product a Debit Note will be issued. Debit Note with payment entry in OMEX for above example is as below: 3.

    "title": "Request for Quotation",
    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Request for Quotation A Request for Quotation is a document that an organization sends to one or more suppliers asking a quotation for items. To access Request for Quotation, open the \"Buying\" workspace and, under \"Reports & Masters\" > \"Buying\", click on \"Request for Quotation\". 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Request for Quotation, it is advised that you create the following first: Supplier Item 2. How to create a Request For Quotation Go to the Request For Quotation list and click on \"+ Add Request for Quotation\". Enter the Required Date, by which you'll need the requested materials. Fill the \"Suppliers\" list with possible suppliers. If you set a Contact and Email Id, that can later be used for sending the Request For Quotation via email and grant access to the supplier portal. In the next table, enter the required items along with UOM and quantity, as well as the target warehouse. The Warehouse can be left blank if Maintain Stock is not enabled for the item. If you want to send the Request for Quotation to your suppliers as an email, you can create an Email Template and select it here. In the template, you can use special variables for supplier specific data: {{ update_password_link }}: A link where your supplier can set a new password to log into your portal. {{ portal_link }}: A link to this RFQ in your supplier portal. {{ supplier_name }}: The company name of your supplier. {{ contact.salutation }} {{ contact.last_name }}: The contact person of your supplier. {{ user_fullname }}: Your full name. Apart from these, you can access all values in this RFQ, like {{ message_for_supplier }} or {{ terms }}. You can check how the email will look for a specific supplier by using the \"Preview Email\" button. 8. If you want to send further attachments to your suppliers, you can enable the checkbox Send Attached Files. This will add each file attached to the Request for Quotation as an attachment to each supplier email. 9. Once you're done, save the Request for Quotation as a draft. 10. When you're ready, you can submit the Request for Quotation. This will trigger an email to each supplier that has Send Email enabled. A Request for Quotation (RFQ) can also be created from a submitted Material Request. Once an RFQ is created, you can print and send suppliers the PDF which will have all the details you entered relevant to the RFQ. You can also get their reply (Supplier Quotation) in OMEX itself, see section 4.1 Supplier Quotation by User. However, for a large number of items, your supplier may be more comfortable with an Excel sheet, etc. 3. Features 3.1 Get items from The items in the items table can be fetched from other documents. The options are: Material Request, Opportunity, and Possible Supplier. Material Request: Items will be fetched from a submitted Material Request that you select. A Material Request can be searched with some matching words and a date range can also be selected to filter the Material Requests. Opportunity: Items will be fetched from a saved Opportunity. A date range can be selected here also. Possible Supplier: Select a possible supplier. Then if you have any submitted Material Requests against this supplier, items can be fetched from that. 3.2 Get Suppliers Instead of entering the suppliers manually in the table, you can also fetch them using the 'Get Suppliers' button. When you click on Tools > Get Suppliers, you will see the field 'Get Suppliers By'. There are two options to fetch suppliers: By Tag or By Group. By tag: Go to 'Tag Category' via searching from the search bar. You must have created tags here first and assigned them to a Supplier in the Buying module. Then you can select 'By Tag'. On clicking Add 'All Suppliers', suppliers with matching tags will be fetched. By Group: Select 'Supplier Group' and choose the supplier group from which suppliers need to be added. For example, if you select Hardware, all your hardware suppliers will be added so that you can get a quote from all of them. In the Supplier table, on expanding a row with the inverted triangle, you'll see an option 'Download PDF' which will open a PDF of the RFQ. 3.3 Link to Material Requests: When you click on Tools > Link to Material Requests, it links the Request for Quotation to available Material Requests. The items should be the same in the Request for Quotation and the Material Request. Now, when the Request for Quotation is saved, you can see in the Dashboard that it is linked to the Material Request. If there are multiple Material Requests with the same items, then the link will be created with the newest Material Request. 3.5 Terms and Conditions In Sales/Purchase transactions, there might be certain Terms and Conditions based on which the Supplier provides goods or services to the Customer. You can apply the Terms and Conditions to transactions and they will appear when printing the document. To know about Terms and Conditions, click here 3.6 Print Settings Letterhead You can print your request for quotation/purchase order on your company's letterhead. Know more here. 'Group same items' will group the same items added multiple times in the items table. This can be seen when you print it. Print Headings Titles of your documents can be changed. Know more here. Special properties When printing a RFQ via the \"Tools > Download PDF\" button, you are asked select the specific supplier you want to address. In the Print Format for RFQ, this information can be accessed via special properties: {{ doc.vendor }} holds the selected supplier ID. {{ doc.items[i].supplier_part_no }} holds the Supplier Part Number of a requested line item. The data of the first supplier will be used while rendering the standard print preview. If you want to print for a different supplier, please use the \"Tools > Download PDF\" button. 4. Creating a Supplier Quotation after RFQ After creation of Request for Quotation, there are two ways to generate Supplier Quotation from Request for Quotation. 4.1 Supplier Quotation by User Open Request for Quotation and click on Supplier Quotation > Create. 2. Select the Supplier, click on the supplier again. In this page, click on the + next to 'Supplier Quotation'. A new Supplier Quotation page will be opened, user has to enter the quantity, rate and submit it. 4.2 Supplier Quotation from Supplier If a Contact is created for the Supplier and an email address is associated with the Contact, the Contact details and the email address will be fetched on selecting the Supplier. Create a Contact and email address if not present already. Click on Tools > Send Emails to Suppliers. If the Supplier's account is not present: The system will create the Supplier's account and send details to the Supplier. The Supplier will need to click on the link (Password Update) present in the email. After the password update, the Supplier can access their portal with the 'Request for Quotation' form. The Supplier will be created as a Website User. If Supplier's account is present: The system will send a Request for Quotation link to the Supplier. The Supplier must log in using his credentials to view the Request for Quotation form on the portal. 3. Either way, when the Supplier logs in, the following screen will be shown to them. From here they can send you a quotation: The Supplier has to enter the amount and notes (payment terms) on the form and click on Submit. In the Quotations section, previous quotations will be visible. 4. On submission, OMEX will create a Supplier Quotation (draft mode) against the Supplier. The user has to review the Supplier Quotation and submit it. When all the items from the Request for Quotation have been quoted by a Supplier, the quote status is updated to 'Received' in the 'Suppliers' table of the Request for Quotation.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Create Supplier Quotation through Supplier Portal In OMEX, Supplier Quotations can either be created manually or via the Supplier Portal. Suppliers can create Quotations via the Supplier Portal once they have logged into the system. Pre-requisites: The Supplier must be a registered Website User with \"Supplier\" role. Supplier user account's Contact must be linked to the Supplier document. For a Supplier to create a Quotation, there should be an existing Request for Quotation (RFQ) against them. To do this entire process, follow the following steps: 1) Create a Request for Quotation for the Supplier in the system. For example, we are creating an RFQ for \"MNO Suppliers\". 2) Now, the Supplier (MNO Suppliers in our case) has to log into the Supplier Portal using their login credentials. There, the Supplier will be able to view the RFQ The Supplier has to enter the Item Rate and submit the RFQ. Once the RFQ is submitted, a Supplier Quotation gets automatically created in the system against this RFQ. Click on the \"View\" option. Observe that the Supplier Quotation is in the Draft state. After reviewing the Supplier Quotation, the user can submit it. This will also be reflected in the Supplier Portal.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Supplier Group Supplier Group is an aggregation of suppliers that are similar in some way. A supplier may be distinguished from a contractor or subcontractor, who commonly adds specialized input to deliverables. A supplier is also known as a vendor. There are different types of suppliers based on the goods and products they supply. OMEX allows you to create your own categories of suppliers. These categories are known as Supplier Groups. For example, if your suppliers are mainly pharmaceutical companies and FMCG distributors, you can create a new Supplier Groups for them and name the groups accordingly. To access Supplier Group, go to: Home Buying > Supplier > Supplier Group 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Supplier Group, it is advised that you create the following first: Supplier 2.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Supplier Suppliers are companies or individuals who provide you with products or services. To access the Supplier list, go to: > Home > Buying > Supplier > Supplier 1. How to create a Supplier Go to the Supplier list and click on New. Enter a name for the supplier. Select the supplier group whether Pharmaceutical, Hardware etc. Save. The options to Warn RFQs, POs, Prevent RFQs, POs will be available once you create a Supplier Scorecard and transactions are made. 2. Features Fields in future transactions will be auto-populated if the 'Default' fields like Default Bank Account, Default Payment Terms Template etc., are set in Supplier. 2.1 Tax details Country: If the supplier is from another country, you can change it here. Tax ID: Tax identification number of the supplier. Tax Category: This is linked to Tax Rule. If a Tax Category is set here, when you select this supplier, the respective Purchase Tax and Charges template will be applied. This template is linked to the Tax Rule and the Tax Rule is linked with a Tax Category. Tax Category can be used to group suppliers to whom same tax will be applied. For example: Government, commercial, etc,. Print Language: The language in which the document will be printed. Tax Withholding Category: For India, TDS category for the Supplier. On setting a category here, it will be fetched into the Purchase Invoice. For more information, visit the Tax Withholding Category page. Disabled: Disables the Supplier and they won't be shown in the Supplier List. Is Transporter: If the supplier is selling your transport services, tick this box. 'GST Transporter ID' field will be visible if this field is ticked. Internal Supplier: If the supplier is from a sister or parent/child company, tick this field and select the company which they represent. For India: GST Category: Select a GST Category of the supplier. PAN: For India, PAN (Permanent Account Number) card details of the Supplier. 2.2 Allow creation of Purchase Invoice without Purchase Order and Purchase Receipt If the \"Purchase Order Required\" or \"Purchase Receipt Required\" option is configured as \"Yes\" in Buying Settings, it can be overridden for a particular supplier by enabling the \"Allow Purchase Invoice Creation Without Purchase Order\" or \"Allow Purchase Invoice Creation Without Purchase Receipt\" in the Supplier Master. 2.3 Currency and Price List Billing Currency: Your supplier's currency can be different from your company currency. If you choose JPY for a supplier, then the currency will be filled as JPY and the exchange rate shown for future purchase transactions. Each Supplier can have a default Price List so that every time you buy a new item from this supplier for different prices, the price list associated with the supplier would be updated as well. Under the price list comes item price, you can see the prices in Buying > Items and Pricing > Item Price. If you select this particular supplier, then the associated Price List will be fetched in Purchase transactions. 2.4 Payment Terms and Block Supplier Default Payment Terms Template: If a Payment Terms template is set here, it'll be automatically selected for future purchase transactions. Block Supplier: You can block invoices, payments or both from a supplier till specific date. Choose 'Hold Type', if you do not select a hold type, OMEX will set it to \"All\". When a supplier is blocked, their status will be shown as 'On Hold'. The hold types are as follows: + Invoices: OMEX will not allow Purchase Invoices or Purchase Orders to be created for the supplier + Payments: OMEX will not allow Payment Entries to be created for the Supplier + All: OMEX will apply both hold types aboveIf you do not set a release date, OMEX will hold the Supplier **indefinitely**. 2.5 Default Payable Accounts Add the default account from which invoices against this supplier will be paid. Add additional rows for more companies, you can select only one account per company. You can integrate a supplier with an account. For all Suppliers, \"Creditor\" account is set as the default payable Account. When Purchase Invoice is created, payable towards the supplier is booked against \"Creditors\" account. If you want to customize payable account for the Supplier, you should first add a payable Account in the Chart of Account, and then select that Payable Account in the Supplier master. If you don't want to customize payable account, and proceed with default payable account \"Creditor\", then do not update any value in the Default Supplier Account's table. Tip: Default Payable Account is set in the Company master. If you want to set another account as Account as default for payable instead of Creditors Account, go to Company master, and set that account as \"Default Payable Account\". Depending on your plan, you can add multiple companies in your OMEX instance. One Supplier can be used across multiple companies. In this case, you should define Company-wise Payable Account for the Supplier in the \"Default Payable Accounts\" table, i.e, add multiple rows. 2.6 More Information You can add the supplier's website and any additional details about your supplier in this section. If you freeze a supplier with the 'Is Frozen' option, accounting entries for the supplier will be frozen. In this case the only user whose entries will surpass the 'freeze' is the role assigned in 'Role Allowed to Set Frozen Accounts & Edit Frozen Entries' in Accounting > Settings > Accounts Settings. This is useful when the supplier's name or bank details are being amended. 2.7 Address and Contacts Contacts and Addresses in OMEX are stored separately so that you can create multiple Contacts and Addresses for one Supplier. Once Supplier is saved, you will find the option to create Contact and Address for that Supplier. Tip: When you select a Supplier in any transaction, Contact for which \"Is Primary\" field id checked, it will auto-fetch with the Supplier details. 2.8 After saving Once all the necessary details are filled, save the document. On saving, options to create the following will be seen in the Dashboard: Request for Quotation: An RFQ against this supplier.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Customer A customer, who is sometimes known as a client, buyer, or purchaser is the one who receives goods, services, products, or ideas, from a seller for a monetary consideration. Every customer needs to be assigned a unique id. Customer name itself can be the id or you can set a naming series for ids to be generated in Selling Settings. To access the Customer list, go to: Home > CRM > Sales Pipeline Or Home > Selling > Customers 1. How to create a Customer Go to the Customer list and click on New. Enter Full Name of the customer. Select Individual if the customer represents an individual or Company if the customer represents a company in Type field. Select a Customer Group. Individual, Commercial, Non Profit and Government are available by default. You can create additional groups if you need. Select the Territory. If the customer is being created against a lead, you can select the same in From Lead field. Save. You can disallow sales orders and sales invoices against a customer by clicking on 'Disabled'. Advanced Tip: If the customer represents one of your own companies then check 'Is Internal Customer'. Check Inter Company Invoices for more details. You can also upload customer details via the Data Import Tool. 2. Features General flow of transactions for a customer is as following: Note: Customers are separate from Contacts and Addresses. A Customer can have multiple Contacts and Addresses. 2.1 Multiple Contacts and Addresses Contacts and Addresses are stored separately so that you can attach multiple Contacts or Addresses to the customer. 2.2 Allow creation of Sales Invoice without Sales Order and Delivery Note If the \"Delivery Note Required\" or \"Sales Order Required\" option is configured as \"Yes\" in Selling Settings, it can be overridden for a particular customer by enabling the \"Allow Sales Invoice Creation Without Sales Order\" or \"Allow Sales Invoice Creation Without Delivery Note\" in the Customer Master. 2.3 Set Tax Withholding Category You can set the Tax Withholding Category to set up TCS against eligible customers. For more information, visit the Tax Withholding Category page. 2.4 Default Currency and Price List OMEX supports Multiple Currencies and Price Lists. You can set the default currency to be used for this customer in sales orders and sales invoices by selecting the appropriate currency in Billing Currency. Similarly, you can set the default price list to be used for this customer in sales orders and sales invoices by selecting the appropriate currency in Default Price List. 2.5 Integration with Accounts Unlike many accounting software, you need not create a separate accounting ledger for each customer. By default a unified ledger named Debtors is created. However if you specifically need a separate ledger for a customer, first create the ledger under Accounts Receivable in the Chart of Accounts and then add it in ACCOUNTING section of the customer. Advanced Tip: OMEX supports Multi-company Accounting. You can use the same customer records in multiple companies. Since an accounting ledger is company specific, you need to select the company and the corresponding ledger in ACCOUNTING section if you decide have separate accounting ledger for a customer. 2.6 Credit Limit and Payment Terms You can set the credit limit by entering the amount in 'Credit Limit' field. Read Credit Limit for more details. You can select the default Payment Terms to be applied in sales orders and sales invoices in 'Default Payment Terms Template' field. 2.7 Sales Team and Sales Partner If you have one or more Sales Person to manage the sales to the customer, you can add them in SALES TEAM section. If multiple sales person are involved you can split the contribution among them. Make sure that the sum of all sales persons contribution equals to 100%. Check Sales Persons in Sales Transaction for more details. A Sales Partner is a third party distributor / dealer / commission agent / affiliate / reseller who facilitates your products/services sales, for a commission. If you sell your products/services to the customer through a sales partner you can set it in 'Sales Partner' field and mention the 'Commission Rate' for calculation of commission. 2.8 Loyalty Program If you would like offer a Loyalty Program to the customer, select the same in Loyalty Program field. 2.9 View Accounting Ledger and Accounts Receivable Click on Accounting Ledger button to view all accounting transactions with the customer. Click on Accounts Receivable button to view the details of all outstanding invoices. 2.10 Set Customer Id, Default Customer Group, Territory, and Price List You can set how a unique id should be generated each the customer in Selling Settings. Naming Series: If you would like a unique id to be generated for each customer based on the naming series select 'Naming Series' in Customer Naming By. Customer Name: If customer name itself should be used as an id then select 'Customer Name' in Customer Naming By. In this case, if you create two customers with identical names, - 1 will be suffixed to the second customer. You can set the default customer group, territory and price list in Selling Settings. You can customize the Customer DocType using Customize Form tool. 3.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Customer Group Customer Group is an aggregation of customers that are similar in some way. Customer groups allow you to organize your customers. Typically Customers are grouped by market segment based on the domain in which a business operates. Customer Groups are created in hierarchical manner in OMEX. You can create a main customer group and add sub customer groups under it. You can define a price a list which will be automatically applied to all customers belonging to that group. You can also get trend analysis for each group. Individual, Commercial and Government customer groups are created by default. You can add your own customer groups based on your requirement like retail, wholesale etc. 1. How to Create a Customer Group Go to CRM > Settings > Customer Group. Click on a parent customer group like 'All Customer Groups'. Click on 'Add Child'. Enter 'Customer Group Name'. Tick 'Group Node' if you would like to add sub customer groups under this. Click on 'Create New'. Tip: If you think all this is too much effort, you can leave it at “Default Customer Group”. But all this effort, will pay off when you start getting reports. An example of a sample report is given below: 2. Features 2.1 Assign Credit Limit, Default Price List, and Default Payment Terms Template You can assign the credit limit, Price List, and Payment Terms and they will be automatically applied when a customer belonging to the customer group is selected in sales transactions like Sales Order and Sales Invoice. 2.2 Default Receivable Account You need not create a separate accounting ledger for each customer in OMEX. Read Common Receivable Account for more details. If you need a separate receivable account for a customer, you can add the same in 'Default Receivable Account' section. 3.

More Accounting Impact All Sales must be booked against an “Income Account”. This refers to an Account in the “Income” section of your Chart of Accounts. It is a good practice to classify your income by type (like product income, service income, etc). The Income Account must be set for each row of the Items table. Tip: To set default Income Accounts for Items, you can set it in the Item or Item Group. The other account that is affected is the Account of the Customer. That is automatically set from “Debit To” in the heading section. You can also mention the Cost Centers in which your Income must be booked. Remember that your Cost Centers tell you the profitability of the different lines of business or product. You can also set a default Cost Center in the Item master. See also: Accounting Dimensions. Accounting entries (GL Entry) for a typical double entry “Sale”: When booking a sale (accrual): Debit: Customer (grand total) Credit: Income (net total, minus taxes for each Item) Credit: Taxes (liabilities to be paid to the government) To see entries in your Sales Invoice after you “Submit”, click on “View Ledger”. 5.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Credit Note A Credit Note is a document sent by a seller to the Customer, notifying that a credit has been made to their account against the goods returned by the buyer. A Credit Note is issued for the value of goods returned by the Customer, it may be less than or equal to the total amount of the order. 1. How to make a Credit Note The user can make a Credit Note against the Sales Invoice or they can directly make Credit Note from the Sales Invoice without reference. Note that to create a Credit Note, the invoice must be paid using a Payment Entry. Go to the respective Sales Invoice and click on Create > Return / Credit Note. The Customer and Item details will be fetched as set in the Sales Invoice. If the Customer had paid partially or fully, make a Payment Entry against the original Sales Invoice. Save and Submit. The Item quantity and Payment amount will be negative since it's a return. 1.1 How does Credit Note affect ledger Once a Payment Entry is created against the original Sales Invoice, the amount will be added to the Customer's account in negative so that the next time they make a purchase, this amount will be adjusted. This is how the ledger is affected after a payment entry against a returned invoice: Refer the Sales Invoice page for any other details. 1.2 No payment was made against Sales Invoice In case no payment was made against the original invoice, you could just cancel the Sales Invoice. But, if only 5 out of 10 Items are being returned from an invoice, creating a Credit Note is useful for updating the ledger. 2. Example Customer Rohan had purchased PVC pipes worth Rs 300 + taxes and at the time of delivery, Customer found that the products were damaged.

      "1. How to make a Credit Note": "The user can make a Credit Note against the Sales Invoice or they can directly make Credit Note from the Sales Invoice without reference. Note that to create a Credit Note, the invoice must be paid using a Payment Entry. Go to the respective Sales Invoice and click on Create > Return / Credit Note.\n\nThe Customer and Item details will be fetched as set in the Sales Invoice.\nIf the Customer had paid partially or fully, make a Payment Entry against the original Sales Invoice.\nSave and Submit. Go to the respective Sales Invoice and click on Create > Return / Credit Note. The Customer and Item details will be fetched as set in the Sales Invoice. Save and Submit. The Item quantity and Payment amount will be negative since it's a return.",
      "1.1 How does Credit Note affect ledger": "Once a Payment Entry is created against the original Sales Invoice, the amount will be added to the Customer's account in negative so that the next time they make a purchase, this amount will be adjusted. This is how the ledger is affected after a payment entry against a returned invoice: Refer the Sales Invoice page for any other details.",
      "1.2 No payment was made against Sales Invoice": "In case no payment was made against the original invoice, you could just cancel the Sales Invoice. But, if only 5 out of 10 Items are being returned from an invoice, creating a Credit Note is useful for updating the ledger.",
      "2. Example": "Customer Rohan had purchased PVC pipes worth Rs 300 + taxes and at the time of delivery, Customer found that the products were damaged. Now Rohan has returned the product a Credit Note will be issued. Credit Note with payment entry in OMEX for above example is as below:",

    "title": "Drop Ship",
    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Drop Ship Drop shipping is a supply chain management method in which the retailer does not keep goods in stock but instead transfers the customer orders and shipment details to either the manufacturer, another retailer, or a wholesaler, who then ships the goods directly to the customer. Drop shipping may also occur when a small retailer (that typically sells in small quantities to the general public) receives a single large order for a product. The retailer may arrange for the goods to be shipped directly to the customer from the manufacturer or distributor. Drop shipping is common with expensive products. No inventory is maintained by the retailer in any case, simply acting as a middleman. In this article, we will see how OMEX provides a seamless drop-shipping experience. Consider a business dealing with Computer Monitors. Now, the retailer has received an order from a customer, ABC Inc. for 1000 DELL 24Inch Monitors. Drop Shipping In Action: 1. Item Configuration Setup Item with mandatory information keeping Maintain Stock disabled since there will be no stocking of this Item. Next, enable \"Delivered By Supplier (Drop Ship) Set the Supplier with whom the Purchase Order will be raised for this orders fulfillment. 2. Sales Cycle: Create Sales Order with Customer, Item, Qty, Rate, Taxes and so on. 3. Order Fulfillment: From the Sales Order Document itself, you can create the Purchase Order for this shipment, track delivery, and bill the customer accordingly.

Review changes Delivery Note A Delivery Note is made when a shipment is shipped from the company’s Warehouse to the customer. A copy of the Delivery Note is usually sent with the transporter. The Delivery Note contains the list of Items that are sent in the shipment and updates the inventory. The Delivery Note is an optional step and a Sales Invoice can be created directly from a Sales Order. To access the Delivery Note list, go to: Home > Stock > Stock Transactions > Delivery Note 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Delivery Note, it is advised that you create the following first: Sales Order Note: From version-13 onwards we have introduced immutable ledger which changes the rules for cancellation of stock entries and posting backdated stock transactions in OMEX. Learn more here. 2. How to create a Delivery Note The entry of the Delivery Note is very similar to a Purchase Receipt.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Point of Sale A Point of Sale refers to the time and place where a retail transaction takes place. For retail operations, the delivery of goods, accrual of sale and payment all happens in one event, that is usually called the 'Point of Sale' (POS). In OMEX Sales Invoices can be generated from the POS. There are two steps to set up POS: To access POS, go to: Home > Retail > Retail Operations > POS 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using Point of Sale, it is advisable to create the following first: POS Profile 2. How to create a POS Invoice Once you set up a POS profile, you can start billing on POS. Go to POS and select a Customer. Add Items from the list displayed on the right by clicking on them. Ensure that the Item has a Selling Price set in the Item Price list. Edit the quantities as needed. In order to edit Rate and Discount, you need to enable them in the POS Profile. A default Warehouse needs to be set to complete the transaction. If Warehouse is set in both Item and POS profile, the one in POS Profile will be given preference. Do note that you need to have Items in your Warehouse before you can sell. If Items are not available, a red dot will be shown next to the Item when selected. When all Items are added, cross check the net and grand totals and also the total quantity in the summary at the bottom. Select the payment mode and click on Complete Order. You'll be asked to submit the Sales Invoice. You can then print the POS invoice. After the Sales Invoice is submitted, you can either print or email it directly to the customer. 2.2 Adding an Item At the billing counter, the retailer needs to select Items which the Customer buys. In the POS interface you can select an Item by two methods. One, is by clicking on the Item image and the other, is through the Barcode / Serial No. Select Item: To select a product click on the Item image and add it into the cart. A cart is an area that prepares a customer for checkout by allowing to edit product information, adjust taxes and add discounts. Barcode / Serial No: A Barcode / Serial No is an optical machine-readable representation of data relating to the object to which it is attached. Enter Barcode / Serial No in the box as shown in the image below and pause for a second, the item will be automatically added to the cart. Tip: To change the quantity of an Item, enter your desired quantity in the quantity box. These are mostly used if the same Item is purchased in bulk. If your product list is very long use the Search field, type the product name in Search box. 2.3 Removing an Item from the Cart Select row in the cart and click on 'Remove' button in the numeric keypad Set Qty as zero to remove Item from the POS invoice. There are two ways to remove an Item. If Item's Qty is 1, click on a minus sign to make it zero. Manually enter 0 (zero) quantity. 2.4 Change Amount POS calculates the extra amount paid by the customer, which user can return from the cash account. User has to set the account for the change amount on the POS profile. 3. Features 3.1 Adding a new Customer In POS, user can select the existing Customer during making an order or create a new customer. This feature works in the offline mode also. User can also add the customer details like contact number, address details, etc on the form. The Customer which has been created from the POS will be synced when the internet connection is active. 3.2 Accounting entries (GL Entry) for a Point of Sale: Debits: Customer (grand total) Bank/Cash (payment) Credits: Income (net total, minus taxes for each Item) Taxes (liabilities to be paid to the government) Customer (payment) Write Off (optional) Account for Change Amount (optional) To see entries after submitting the Sales Invoice, click on View Ledger. 3.3 Email You can also send the receipt via email. 3.4 Create Return Credit Note You can also create a return credit note against a POS Invoice in case of return of items or the entire order. Below are the steps for issuing a credit note against an invoice: Click on menu (3 dots) and then click on Toggle Recent Orders. Keyboard shortcut for the same is ⌘+O. All the invoices from recent POS transactions will be displayed under the Recent Orders pane. You can either search for the invoice directly with its name or filter search results as per the status of the invoice which can be Paid, Consolidated, Draft, Return. Select the invoice against which you need to create the credit note after which you will see the invoice details and the options to Print, Email the receipt and an option to make a Return. Click on 'Return'. The POS screen will display the items in the invoice, along with respective negative quantities and totals in the Item Cart which indicates that it is a return credit note. Once you checkout, you'll see the Grand Total, Paid Amount and Taxes too if applicable. Clicking on Complete Order will complete the process and create the final return credit invoice and display the bill on the screen like a normal order 3.5 POS Closing Voucher At the end of the day, the cashier can close his/her PoS by creating a POS Closing Voucher. Click on the Menu and select 'Close the POS'. Select the period, your POS Profile and your user to retrieve all sales registered. At the end of the day, the cashier can close his/her shift by creating a POS Closing Voucher. Click on the Menu and select 'Close the POS'. Select the period, your POS Profile and your user to retrieve all sales registered. On creating a POS Closing Voucher, all the POS invoices fetched for the selected period will be consolidated into one final Sales Invoice. The status of all the POS invoices will change from 'Paid' to 'Consolidated' once they are successfully consolidated into a sales invoice on closing. If there are more than 10 invoices while closing a POS, consolidation of the invoices will take place in a background job and would be subitted after the background job gets completed. The Accounting Ledgers would be affected only after the Closing Voucher is submitted successfully and the consolidated sales invoices are created. 4.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes POS Invoice Consolidation In the version 13 refactor of the Point of Sale, in an effort to add speed to the Point of Sale, the sales from the POS session do not affect the stock and accounting ledgers until a Closing POS Voucher is submitted for that session. It functions like so: Each transaction from the POS screen now creates an intermediate invoice (called a POS Invoice) which doesn’t update the stock and accounting ledgers to keep it as fast as possible. This is also called a “sub-ledger”. Separating the POS ledger from the General Ledger makes the system a lot more scalable. The stock and accounting entries are now created at the end of day while closing a POS session by a single sales invoice which merges all the intermediate invoices created throughout the day. This single consolidated sales invoice only creates 3-4 ledger entries. The older system would create n x 3 ledger entries where ‘n’ is the number of invoices created throughout the day. Since drastically fewer ledger entries are made, the load on the general ledger is also eased, making it faster. How Stock is Tracked Until a POS Session is Closed While it is true that the Stock Ledger will disclude transactions from any active POS session, the stock levels from this \"sub-ledger\" update the Stock Projected Quantity Report. Stock > Stock Reports > Stock Projected Quantity In the above image, the \"Actual Qty\" column represents the value of the stock ledger. The \"Reserved for POS Transactions\" represents the \"Actual Qty\" less what quantities are currently reserved because of active POS sessions that have not yet made entries on the Stock Ledger because the sessions have not been closed. Note also that \"Projected Qty\" (\"Active Qty\" less quantities reserved for the POS, production, etc.) adds a quantity of 100 to the first line item because of an order for 100 units that has yet to be received. Within the Point of Sale, however, quantities on order but not received will not be reflected in the \"Available Qty at Warehouse\" field in the Item Details view. In the instance below, as there's not enough quantity on-hand, the transaction won't be permitted. This applies to any and all open POS sessions active at any time and is applied globally (as in, the transaction from one session affects the quantities available for all other open sessions).

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Point of Sale Profile In OMEX, a POS profile allows using the Point of Sale feature. POS includes advanced features to cater to different functionality, such as inventory management, CRM, financials, warehousing, etc., all built into the POS software. Before modern POS, all of these functions were done independently and required the manual re-keying of information, which could lead to entry errors. If you are in retail operations, you want your Point of Sale to be as quick and efficient as possible. To do this, you can create a POS Profile for a user. To access the POS Profile list, go to: Home > Retail > Retail Operations > Point-of-Sale Profile 1. How to create a POS Profile Go to the Point-of-Sale Profile and click on New. Enter a name for the profile. Set a Write Off Account and Write Off Cost Center to which the transactions will be recorded. Set up payment modes in the table, the default will be cash if nothing is set here. Only the modes set here will be available when using POS. After adding payment modes, set one of them as the default payment method by ticking the checkbox. 5. Set the default amounts for the payment methods (recommended: 0). 6. Save. 1.1 Additional options when creating a POS Profile Customer: Users can sell particular products to the particular Customers from the POS by adding item groups, customer groups in the POS Profile. Warehouse: The stock quantities in the selected Warehouse will be affected for POS transactions with this POS Profile. Campaign: A sales Campaign can be linked here to track total sales against it. Company Address: If the POS counter is set up at a Company branch, the address can be selected here. Update Stock: If enabled, the stock quantities will be affected when transactions are performed with the POS Profile. That is, Stock Ledger Entries will be made when you “Submit” this Sales Invoice thereby eliminating the need for a separate Delivery Note. Ignore Pricing Rule: Any active Pricing Rule will be ignored for this POS Profile. Allow Delete: In Offline POS, the data is cached. Ticking this checkbox will allow User to delete the Sales Invoice cached in the Draft stage. Allow user to edit Rate: The POS Profile user will be allowed to edit the 'Rate' of Items added in transactions. Allow user to edit Discount: The POS Profile user will be allowed to edit the 'Discount' of Items added in transactions. Allow Print Before Pay: This will allow the POS User to print an invoice before the payment is made. Display Items In Stock: The remaining quantity of Items from the selected Warehouse will be shown to the POS User. 2. Features 2.1 Applicable for Users By default, all Sales Users can access the POS Profiles created in OMEX. However, if you want only certain Users to access certain POS Profiles, you can add them to the table. Once even one User is set in the POS Profile, other Users cannot use this POS Profile for retail transactions. Setting POS Profile as default: On ticking the Default checkbox in the table, the current POS Profile becomes the default POS Profile for that User. So, the next time the User logs into the system, the POS Profile will be set by default. Note: If you specify a particular User, the POS setting will be applied only to that User. If the User option is left blank, the setting will be set for all users. To understand how POS works, visit the Point of Sale page. 2.2 Setting Item Group and Customer Group On setting an Item Group/Customer Group in a POS Profile, the group will be automatically selected when making transactions with the POS Profile. 2.3 Print Settings Print Format for Online You can set a Print Format which will decide what the layout of the printed document will look like. To know more, visit the Print Format page. Letterhead You can print your POS Sales Invoice on your Company's letterhead. Know more here. Print Headings POS Sales Invoice headings can also be changed when printing the document. For example, the heading can be 'Invoice', or 'Bill'. You can do this by selecting a Print Heading. To create new Print Headings go to: Home > Settings > Printing > Print Heading. Know more here. Terms and Conditions There may be certain terms and conditions on the Item you're selling, these can be applied here. To know about adding Terms and Conditions, click here. 2.4 Accounting Price List: A Price List stores the Item Prices. Setting a Price List here will fetch the Item Prices for the current POS Profile from that Price List. Currency: By default, this will be set according to the Company's default currency. However, you can change it. In case you change the currency, remember to change the accounts too. Taxes and Charges: Selecting a Sales Taxes and Charges Template or Purchase Taxes and Charges Template here will automatically apply the taxes and charges to the POS transaction. Apply Discount On: Here you can set whether the discount is to be applied on the Grand Total (pre tax amount) or the Net Total (post tax amount). Tax Category: On selecting a Tax Category here, the Tax Rules associated with the Tax Category will be applied to each transaction performed from this POS Profile. The following accounts can be set so that the general ledger is updated accordingly: Account for Change Amount Write Off Account Write Off Cost Center Income Account Expense Account 2.5 Accounting Dimensions Accounting Dimensions lets you tag transactions based on a specific Territory, Branch, Customer, etc. This helps in viewing accounting statements separately based on the criteria selected. To know more, visit the Accounting Dimensions page. Note: Cost Center is treated as a dimension by default. 3.

Review changes Loyalty Program A Loyalty Program allows Customers to earn points by spending a certain amount and lets them redeem the points in future purchases. A Customer Loyalty Program is a structured and long-term marketing effort that provides incentives to repeat Customers. Successful programs are designed to motivate Customers in a business's target market to return often, make frequent purchases, and shun competitors. To access the Loyalty Program list, go to: Home > Retail > Retail Operations > Loyalty Program 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Loyalty Program, it is advised to create the following first: Customer Sales Invoice 2. How to Create a Loyalty Program Go to the Loyalty Program list and click on New. Enter a Name for the Loyalty Program. Select whether the program is Single Tiered or Multi Tiered (gold, silver, etc). Set a start and end date for the program. Select the Customer Group and Territory for which this program is applicable, the default is all. For opting in all Customers by default, tick on 'Auto Opt In (For all customers)'. Otherwise, the program needs to be assigned from the Customer master. In the table, enter: Tier name: To be assigned to a Customer based on his eligibility. Collection Factor: How much amount needs to be spent to gain 1 Loyalty Point in OMEX. Minimum Amount: Minimum amount to be spent to qualify into a tier. Set the Conversion Factor, eg: 10 USD = 1 point. Save. 2.1 Redemption section Conversion Factor: When redeeming loyalty points, this factor decides how much money is 1 Loyalty Point worth. For example, if a Customer has 100 Loyalty Points, and 1 Loyalty Point = 1 USD, then the Customer use Items up to 100 USD with their loyalty points for future purchases. Expense Account: Set an Expense Account from where you'll offer the benefits. This is useful to track the benefits offered separately. Expiry Duration (in days): The collected loyalty points will expire after the number of days set in this field. 2.2 Loyalty Points in Customer Set a Loyalty Program section in the Customer master to assign a Loyalty Program to a Customer. Loyalty points earned can be viewed in the Customer's dashboard. 2.3 Loyalty Point Entry Go to: Accounts > Retail Operations > Loyalty Point Entry. This acts as a log to give an overview of which Customer earned how many points against which Sales Invoice. It holds the data Invoice and Customer. 3. How does a Loyalty Program work? 3.1 Earning Points Firstly, a Loyalty Program needs to be created as explained in the first section. Assign this Loyalty Program to a Customer. Create a new Sales Invoice for the Customer to whom you have assigned Loyalty Program. For this example, an invoice is created with a grand total of 3,000 INR and according to the Loyalty Program for a minimum spent of 2,000 INR, the Silver Tier collection factor will be eligible and for each 300 INR spent, the Customer will receive 1 point (hence the total points earned on this transaction is 15). Upon submission of the invoice, a Loyalty Point Entry will be created for this invoice (as shown above under Loyalty Program Entry section). In our Loyalty Program upon minimum spent of 6,000, Gold Tier would be eligible. So, when another invoice is submitted with the same value, the total sales from this Customer becomes 6,000. So now, the Customer will be automatically upgraded to the Gold tier. Note: The minimum spent in Loyalty Program does not mean a minimum value for a single invoice. Rather it means the sum of amount of invoices for the Customer under a particular Loyalty Program scheme. 3.2 Redeeming Points Let's continue from the above example where we created 1 invoice and earned 15 points from it. When creating another invoice for the same Customer, go to the Loyalty Points section and enable the checkbox to 'Redeem Loyalty Points'. The fields for 'Loyalty Point', 'Redemption Account' and 'Redemption Cost Center' will become visible under this section. The account and Cost Center will be fetched from the Loyalty Program assigned to the Customer. Since the Customer has earned 15 points, we can use all of it until expiry. If we try to use more than what we have an error will be thrown. In above example, we have used 6375 points to be redeemed. Doing so will enable another field that will display the amount calculated using (loyalty point * Conversion Factor). So, USD 6375 will be deducted from our the amount since our 'Conversion Factor' was '1'. When submitted, 2 Loyalty Point Entries will be created. One for redeemed, which will be a negative value and one for the current invoice. Note: For an invoice on which points have been earned, if a return invoice is created, it will delete the original Loyalty Point Entry and create a new one after subtracting the returned amount from the original amount. Also, when canceling an invoice, its subsequent Loyalty Point Entry will be deleted. 4.

Review changes Selling Settings Selling Settings is where you can define properties and validations which will be applied to the masters and transactions involved in the sales cycle. To access Selling Settings, go to: Home > Selling > Settings > Selling Settings Customer Defaults 1. Customer Naming By When a customer is saved, a unique ID is generated for that Customer. By default, Customer ID is generated based on Customer Name. If you wish to save Customer using a naming series, in the field Customer Naming Series, set value as \"Naming Series\". Example of Customer ID's saved in Naming Series - \"CUST00001, CUST00002, CUST00003...\" and so on. 2. Default Customer Group Select a default Customer Group which will be auto-updated when creating a new Customer. Quotations can be created for the Customers as well as for the Leads. When converting a Quotation into a Sales Order, which is created for a Lead, the system attempts to convert that Lead into a Customer. While creating Customer in the backend, the value for Customer Group is picked from Selling Settings. If no default values are found for Customer Group, then you will receive a validation message asking for the Customer Group. You can also manually convert a Lead into a Customer. 3. Default Territory Select a default Territory which will be auto-updated when creating a new Customer. Quotations can be created for the Customers as well as for the Leads. When converting a Quotation into a Sales Order, which is created for a Lead, the system attempts to convert that Lead into a Customer.

Default Price List Price List set in this field will be auto-updated in the Price List field of sales transactions like Quotation, Sales Order, Delivery Note, and Sales Invoice. 2. Maintain Same Rate Throughout Sales Cycle It ensures that the same rate is maintained throughout the sales process. Once enabled, OMEX will validate whether an Item's price is changing in a Delivery Note or Sales Invoice created from a Sales Order. 3. Action if Same Rate is Not Maintained Throughout Sales Cycle You can configure the action that system should take if the same rate is not maintained in the \"Action If Same Rate is Not Maintained Throughout Sales Cycle\" field: Stop: OMEX will stop you from changing the price by throwing a validation error. Warn: The system will let you save the transaction but warn you with a message if the rate is changed. Note: This field will only be visible if Maintain Same Rate Throughout Sales Cycle is enabled. 4. Role Allowed to Override Stop Action Allow users to add role to override \"Stop\" action for Maintain Same Rate Throughout Sales Cycle, if Action if Same Rate is Not Maintained was set to Stop. Note: This field will only be visible if 'Maintain Same Rate Throughout Sales Cycle' is enabled and 'Action if Same Rate is Not Maintained' is set to Stop. 5. Allow User to Edit Price List Rate in Transactions The item table in sale transactions has a field called Price List Rate. This field is non-editable by default in all the sales transactions. This is to ensure that the price of an item is fetched from Item Price record and the user is not able to edit it. If you need the Item Price fetched from Price List of an item to be editable, you should uncheck this field. 6. Validate Selling Price for Item Against Purchase Rate or Valuation Rate When making sales, it's important to know that you're not making losses. Enabling this validation will validate the item's Selling Price with its valuation/buying price. If an item's selling price is found to be less than it's buying price, then you will get a prompt when this checkbox is ticked. 7. Calculate Product Bundle Price based on Child Items' Rates Enabling this will do the following: Make the Rate column of all Packed/Bundle Items tables editable. Calculate the prices of all Product Bundles in the Items table, based on the prices of its Child Items, specified in the Packed/Bundle Items table. Note: If this is enabled, updating the rate of the Product Bundle in the Items table will not change its price. It will get reset to the price based on its Child Items on saving the doc. 8. Allow Negative Rate for Items Enable this option to permit the use of negative rates for items in sales transactions. This setting is useful for applying substantial discounts, processing refunds or returns, and handling special promotional pricing. Transaction Settings 1. Is Sales Order Required for Sales Invoice & Delivery Note Creation? If you wish to make Sales Order creation mandatory before the creation of a Sales Invoice or a Delivery Note, then you should set the 'Sales Order Required' field as 'Yes'. By default, this will be 'No'. This configuration can be overridden for a particular customer by enabling the \"Allow Sales Invoice Creation Without Sales Order\" checkbox in customer master. 2. Is Delivery Note Required for Sales Invoice Creation? To make Delivery Note creation as mandatory before Sales Invoice creation, you should set this field as 'Yes'. By default, this will be 'No'. This configuration can be overridden for a particular customer by enabling the \"Allow Sales Invoice Creation Without Delivery Note\" checkbox in customer master 3. Sales Update Frequency The frequency at which project progress and company transaction details will be updated. By default it is for Each Transaction, you can also set it to Daily or Monthly if you have a lot of transactions every day. 4. Blanket Order Allowance (%) It indicates the percentage one is allowed to sell beyond the Blanket Order quantity 5. Allow Item to be Added Multiple Times in a Transaction This is a validation check which prevents an item from being added multiple times in the same transaction when unchecked. In some cases, this might be an explicit need if so check this box. 6. Allow Multiple Sales Orders Against a Customer's Purchase Order When creating a Sales Order, you can update the Purchase Order ID and Date received from the Customer. You can create only one Sales Order against the Customer's PO No. and Date. However, if you wish to allow the creation of multiple Sales Orders against the same PO No. of the Customer, tick the checkbox \"Allow multiple Sales Orders against a Customer's Purchase Order\". 7. Allow Sales Order Creation For Expired Quotation This allows creation of sales orders from quotations that have passed their expiration date, providing flexibility in processing orders despite outdated quotes. 8. Don't Reserve Sales Order Qty on Sales Return It prevents the automatic reservation of stock quantities from sales orders when processing sales returns. 9. Hide Customer's Tax ID from Sales Transactions As per the statutory requirement, most of the Customers have unique Tax ID assigned to them. They also need to have this tax ID fetched in the selling transactions. However, if you don't wish to use this functionality, you can disable by checking this property. 10. Enable Discount Accounting for Selling Once enabled, additional ledger entries will be made for discounts in a separate Discount Account Selling Settings administrator edited 6 months ago × No Revisions Previous Next Page Settings × Route omex/ Hide on Sidebar Update Preview Discard Save Toggle Dropdown Draft Title Content Title Enter title for the new Wiki Group Submit Was this article helpful?

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Sales Reports You can view your company's sales performance, analyze sales data in different views to see the sales performance. With filters, you can dynamically change what is displayed. There are three window areas that make up the Sales Analytics Report-The Filter Toolbar Window, the Graph Window and the Data Window shown as follows: These analytics can be found under: Home > Selling > Key Reports 1. Sales Analytics Report Go to Selling > Analytics > Sales Analytics. The Sales Analytics report looks like this: The toolbar provides filters to select what data is to be used. Using the dropdown selections, the data displayed can be refined. As the selections are made, data is reflected in the data window as well as the graph window. Within the data window, selections can be made to expand or compress the data to be analyzed. Each box can be selected or unselected. There is no restriction for data comparison, so a higher level can be compared to a lower level. Using the 'Set Chart' button, you can set values for the X and Y fields, use different type of charts and select a color. 2. Sales Funnel Report Go to Selling > Analytics. The report \"Sales Funnel\" provides a sales generation analysis. It displays the progression of stages in the sales process. There are four stages leading up to a Sales Order: Active Leads, Opportunities, Quotations and Converted (has become a Customer). Active Leads shows the number of all your Leads, including all the other stages. Opportunities shows the number of Leads for which an Opportunity was created. Quotation shows the number of leads for which a Quotation was submitted. Converted shows the number of leads for which a Quotation and Sales Order was submitted. The earlier stages usually include the later stages. However, if an earlier stage was skipped, you might see counterintuitive results like two Quotations resulting from one Opportunity (because it is not mandatory to create an Opportunity first). Once a date range has been selected, the graph is updated, the graph reflects the changes and the associated labels. 3. Customer Acquisition and Loyalty Report Go to Selling > Analytics. To understand revenue, it's often helpful to look at the data from a new customer and existing customers standpoint. This report helps visualize customer loyalty. There are two windows within this report: The Filter Window and the Data Window. Accessing the Filter Window, the company and date ranges can be applied. Data is updated in the Data Window as changes are applied. Within the Data Window, columns of information are accessible. Moving columns: The columns can be moved, re-arranged by clicking on the column headings and dragging them. Sorting: To sort the data in columns, click on the right-hand side of a column heading and you'll see options to sort as ascending, descending, reset sorting, or remove a column. Filtering: The text boxes below the column headings work as instant filters. Enter a number there and all matching records will be shown.

      "1. Sales Analytics Report": "Go to Selling > Analytics > Sales Analytics. The Sales Analytics report looks like this: The toolbar provides filters to select what data is to be used. Using the dropdown selections, the data displayed can be refined. As the selections are made, data is reflected in the data window as well as the graph window. Within the data window, selections can be made to expand or compress the data to be analyzed. Each box can be selected or unselected. There is no restriction for data comparison, so a higher level can be compared to a lower level. Using the 'Set Chart' button, you can set values for the X and Y fields, use different type of charts and select a color.",
      "2. Sales Funnel Report": "Go to Selling > Analytics. The report \"Sales Funnel\" provides a sales generation analysis. It displays the progression of stages in the sales process. There are four stages leading up to a Sales Order: Active Leads, Opportunities, Quotations and Converted (has become a Customer). Active Leads shows the number of all your Leads, including all the other stages.\nOpportunities shows the number of Leads for which an Opportunity was created.\nQuotation shows the number of leads for which a Quotation was submitted.\nConverted shows the number of leads for which a Quotation and Sales Order was submitted. The earlier stages usually include the later stages. However, if an earlier stage was skipped, you might see counterintuitive results like two Quotations resulting from one Opportunity (because it is not mandatory to create an Opportunity first). Once a date range has been selected, the graph is updated, the graph reflects the changes and the associated labels.",
      "3. Customer Acquisition and Loyalty Report": "Go to Selling > Analytics.\nTo understand revenue, it's often helpful to look at the data from a new customer and existing customers standpoint. This report helps visualize customer loyalty. There are two windows within this report: The Filter Window and the Data Window. Accessing the Filter Window, the company and date ranges can be applied. Data is updated in the Data Window as changes are applied. Within the Data Window, columns of information are accessible. Moving columns: The columns can be moved, re-arranged by clicking on the column headings and dragging them.\nSorting: To sort the data in columns, click on the right-hand side of a column heading and you'll see options to sort as ascending, descending, reset sorting, or remove a column.\nFiltering: The text boxes below the column headings work as instant filters. Enter a number there and all matching records will be shown.

Review changes Serialized Inventory Duration: 5:33 If an Item is serialized, a Serial Number (Serial No) record is maintained for each unit of that Item. This information is helpful in tracking the location of the Serial No, its warranty and end-of-life (expiry) information. This video walks you through setting item as serialized item, and creating stock transaction for it. Mostly a high value items are set as serialized item which requires close tracking of its location and warranty expiry.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Item An Item is a product or a service offered by your company. The term Item is also applicable to raw materials or components of products yet to be produced (before they can be sold to customers). OMEX allows you to manage all sorts of items like raw-materials, sub-assemblies, finished goods, item variants, and service items. OMEX is optimized for itemized management of your sales and purchase. If you are in services, you can create an Item for each service that you offer. Completing the Item Master is very essential for the successful implementation of OMEX. To access the Item list, go to: > Home > Stock > Items and Pricing > Item 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using an Item, it is advised that you create the following first: Item Group Warehouse A Unit of Measure if required 2. How to create an Item Go to the Item list, click on new. Enter an Item Code, the name will be auto-filled the same as Item Code on clicking inside the Item Name field. Select an Item Group. Enter the opening stock units and standard selling rate. Save. 2.1 Item Properties Item Name: Item name is the actual name of your product or service. Item Code: Item Code is a short-form to denote your Item. If you have very few Items, it is advisable to keep the Item Name and the Item Code same. This helps new users to recognize and update Item details in all transactions. In case you have a lot of Items with long names and the list runs in hundreds, it is advisable to code. To understand naming Item codes see Item Codification. You can also generate Item Code based on a Naming Series by enabling this feature in Stock Settings.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Brand A Brand identifies items with a specific name. Usually, a Brand is the manufacturer or packer of a specific product. For example, Apple is a brand that manufactures laptops. A Brand is not necessarily the Manufacturer of an Item, it's only the name under which a product is sold. For example, if you manufacture plastic cups, you may license it to a big brand so that they sell it under their Brand. In OMEX, Brands can be assigned to Items for identifying and assigning certain defaults. To access the Brand list, go to: Home > Selling > Sales > Brand 1. How to Create a Brand Go to the Brand list and click on New. Enter a Brand name and enter a description if needed. Save. Now this Brand can be associated with different Items. 2. Features 2.1 Setting defaults for Items of this Brand The following defaults can be set for a Brand. On assigning this brand to an Item, the set defaults will be fetched when performing Sales/Purchase transactions with Item of this Brand. Default Warehouse: The Warehouse from which the Item will be sourced/stored depending on the transaction. Default Price List: The Price List set here will be fetched in Purchase/Sales transactions. Purchase Defaults When performing Purchase transactions like Purchase Order, Purchase Receipt, or Purchase Invoice, the defaults set here will be fetched on selecting Item of this Brand.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Product Bundle A Product Bundle is a master where you can list existing items which are bundled together and sold as a set (or bundle). For instance, when you sell a smartphone, you need to ensure that the charger, cable, and sim ejector pin are delivered with it and stock levels of these items get affected. To address this scenario, you can create a Product Bundle for the main item, i.e. smartphone. Then list deliverable items i.e. smartphone + charger + cable + sim ejector pin as so-called \"Child Items\". A Product Bundle can be seen as a \"Bill-of-Materials\" on the Sales side. Following are the steps to set up a Product Bundle and using it in sales transactions. To access product bundle, go to: Home > Selling > Items and Pricing > Product Bundle 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Product Bundle, it is advised that you create the following first: Item 2. How to create a Product Bundle Go to the Product Bundle list, click on Add Product Bundle. Select a Parent Item, create one if not already created. Make sure Maintain Stock unchecked when creating a Parent Item. eg: Dinner Set. Enter a price for the parent item, this will be fetched when making a transaction. You can enter a description for internal use. Enter the products to be bundled in the Items table and enter their quantities. Save. 2.1 Selecting Parent Item In Product Bundle master, there are two sections. The \"Parent Item\" and a List of items to be shipped (Child Items). The \"Parent Item\" should be seen more like a vessel or virtual item and not a physical product. The \"Parent Item\" must be a non-stock item. To create a non-stock item you have to unmark \"Maintain Stock\" in the Item Form. This is a non-stock item because there is no stock maintained for it but only for the \"Child Items\". If you want to maintain stock for the Parent Item, then you must create a regular Bill of Material (BOM) and package them using Stock Entry Transactions. 2.2 Selecting Child Items In the Items table, you have to list all the child items for which we maintain stock and is delivered to customer. Remember: The \"Parent Item\" is just virtual, so your main product (a smartphone in our example here) also has to be listed on the List of Child (or Package) Items. 3. Features 3.1 Product Bundle in the Sales Transactions When making Sales transactions (Sales Invoice, Sales Order, Delivery Note) the Parent Item will be selected in the main item table. On selection of a Parent Item in the main item table, its child items will be fetched in Packing List table of the transaction. If child item is the serialized item, you will be able to specify its Serial No. in packing List table itself. On submission of the transaction, the system will reduce the stock level of child items from warehouse specified in Packing List table. Use Product Bundle to Manage Offers/Schemes: This was discovered when a customer dealing into nutrition products asked for a feature to manage offers like \"Buy One Get One Free\". To manage the same, he created a non-stock item which was used as Parent Item. In description of item, he entered offer details with the item's image displaying the offer. The sellable product was selected in Package Item where qty was two. Hence every time they sold one qty of Parent item under this offer, the system deducted two quantities of product from Warehouse. 4.

  "OMEX Item Variants": {
    "title": "Item Variants",
    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Item Variants An Item Variant is a version of an Item with different attributes like sizes or colors. Eg: Suppose t-shirt is an Item and it comes in different sizes and colors like small, medium, large and red, blue, green. In OMEX the t-shirt will be considered as an Item template and each of the variations will be an Item Variant. A _blue_ t-shirt in size _small_ rather than just a t-shirt. Item variants let you treat the _small_, _medium_, and _large_ versions of a t-shirt as variations of one Item 't-shirt'. Without Item variants, you would have to treat the _small_, _medium_ and _large_ versions of a t-shirt as three separate Items. 1. Using Item Variants Variants can be based on two things: Item Attributes Manufacturers Tip: Once an item template is created, when you update this template, all the variants are also updated accordingly. 1.1 Creating the Item Variant Template To use Item Variants in OMEX, create an Item and tick 'Has Variants' under Variants. The Item then shall be referred to as a so-called 'Template'. Such a Template is not identical to a regular 'Item' any longer. For example, it (the Template) cannot be used directly in any transaction (Sales Order, Delivery Note, Purchase Invoice) itself. Only the Variants of the Item (_blue_ t-shirt in size _small)_ can be practically used. Therefore it would be ideal to decide whether an item 'Has Variants' or not directly when creating it. On selecting 'Has Variants' a table will appear. Specify the variant attributes for the Item in the table. In case the attribute has Numeric Values, you can specify the range and create intervals based on the increment values. Note: You cannot make Transactions against a 'Template'. 1.2 Creating the Item Variants Based on Item Attributes To create 'Item Variants' against a 'Template' click on 'Create'. From there, choose whether to create a single variant or multiple. Single is simple where you create just one or more attributes and one Item will be created. When choosing multiple variants, tick the attributes and multiple items will be created. For example, if you choose Color: Red, Green and Size: Small, Medium, Large, 6 variants will be created. Creating multiple variants in OMEX: To learn more about setting attributes check out Item Attributes 1.3 Item Variants Based on Manufacturers To setup variants based on Manufacturers, in your Item template, set \"Variants Based On\" as \"Manufacturers\" In this case, to create variants, click on Create > Make Variant. The system will prompt you to select a Manufacturer. You can also optionally put in a Manufacturer Part Number.

      "1.1 Creating the Item Variant Template": "To use Item Variants in OMEX, create an Item and tick 'Has Variants' under Variants.\nThe Item then shall be referred to as a so-called 'Template'. Such a Template is not identical to a regular 'Item' any longer. For example, it (the Template) cannot be used directly in any transaction (Sales Order, Delivery Note, Purchase Invoice) itself.\nOnly the Variants of the Item (_blue_ t-shirt in size _small)_ can be practically used. Therefore it would be ideal to decide whether an item 'Has Variants' or not directly when creating it.\n\nOn selecting 'Has Variants' a table will appear. Specify the variant attributes for the Item in the table. In case the attribute has Numeric Values, you can specify the range and create intervals based on the increment values.\n\n\nNote: You cannot make Transactions against a 'Template'.

Single is simple where you create just one or more attributes and one Item will be created. When choosing multiple variants, tick the attributes and multiple items will be created.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Item Alternative An Item Alternative is an Item similar to the original one and can be used instead of the original Item in manufacturing. If the raw material defined in the BOM is not available during the production process then their respective available alternative Item can be used to complete the production process. First you need to enable the \"Allow Alternative Item\" in the Item. To access the Item alternative list, go to: Home > Stock > Items and Pricing > Item Alternative This can also be done by clicking the plus sign next to 'Item Alternative' from the Item master dashboard. You can enable Two-Way replacement between an Item and their alternative item if both can be used as an alternative to each other. 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using an Item Alternative, it is advised that you create the following first: Item 2. Item Alternative for Work Order To allow to using alternative Items in the manufacturing process, the user can configure to 'Allow Alternative Item' in the BOM/Work Order 2.1 Provision to allow alternative item in the BOM You can enable 'Allow Alternative Item' in a BOM then select the alternative item in the Stock Entry. This can also be done with a Work Order. 2.2 Provision to allow alternative item in the Work Order User can also enable/disable allow alternative item for individual Work Orders. Ticking on the 'Allow Alternative Item' checkbox will show a button named 'Alternate Item'. You can click on this to set the Item Alternative in the Work Order. This is how you use Item Alternative in a Work Order: This is how you use Item Alternative with a Stock Entry: If the 'Allow Alternative Item' checkbox in the Item table is disabled, you cannot set an Alternate Item for this Item. 2.3 Item Alternative for subcontract In subcontract, the user has to transfer raw materials to the subcontracted supplier to get finished good from them. If the raw material is not available in the stock, with this feature, the user can transfer the alternate item of the subcontracted raw material to the supplier. This is done in the Stock Entry. After this, when you create a Purchase Receipt from the Work Order, the alternate item will be shown. 3.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Warehouse A warehouse is a commercial building for storage of goods. Warehouses are used by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport businesses, customs, etc. They are usually large plain buildings in industrial areas of cities, towns, and villages. They mostly have loading docks to load and unload goods from trucks. The terminology of 'Warehouse' in OMEX is a bit broader though and maybe can be regarded as \"storage locations\". You can create a sub-Warehouse which could be a shelf inside your actual location. This can become quite a detailed Tree like the following: Warehouse > Room > Row > Shelf > Bin To access the Warehouse list, go to: Home > Stock > Settings > Warehouse 1. How to create a Warehouse Go to the Warehouse list, click on New. Enter a name for the Warehouse. Set/check the Parent Warehouse. If you tick on 'Is Group', you can create sub-Warehouses under this group Warehouse. Save. Warehouses are saved with their respective Company’s abbreviations. This facilitates identifying which Warehouse belongs to which company at a glance. 1.1 Additional options when creating a Warehouse Account: Set a default account here for all transactions with this Warehouse. Setting this account will show transactions from this Warehouse in the Accounting Ledger. Warehouse Type: You can create a Warehouse Type to classify Warehouses. For example, Supplier Warehouses, Stock Warehouses, WIP Warehouses, Rooms, etc. can be tagged. This classification is useful when generating reports or in certain stock transactions. Address and contact You can add Billing, Shipping, and other types of addresses for the Warehouse. You can also add a contact, this could be the Warehouse Manager for example. 1.2 After Saving After saving a Warehouse, you'll see the following options: Stock Balance: This will open the Stock Balance report to display the quantity, valuation, balance, etc. General Ledger: This will open the General Ledger to display the accounting transactions. Non-Group to Group: If the Warehouse is a Non-Group Warehouse, i.e. cannot contain other Warehouses under it, this button will make this a Group Warehouse. 2. Features 2.1 Tree View You can also switch to 'Tree' View which will show all the group and child Warehouses. 2.2 Warehouse Account In OMEX, if you enable Perpetual Inventory, every Warehouse must belong to a specific company to maintain company-wise stock balance. To do so, each Warehouse should be linked with an Account in the Chart of Accounts (the same name as the Warehouse itself). This account captures the monetary equivalent of the goods or materials stored in that specific warehouse. If you have a more detailed Warehouse Tree, most likely it's a good idea to link the sub-locations (room, row, shelf, etc.) to the account of the actual Warehouse (the root Warehouse of that Tree) as most scenarios do not require to account for value of stock items per Shelf or Bin. For example, if you have Warehouse A, and the room, rows are B, C, etc., then link B and C to the account of A. Tip: OMEX maintains stock balance for every distinct combination of Item and Warehouse. Thus you can get the stock balance for any specific Item in a particular Warehouse on any particular date. 3.

By default, there are many UoMs created in OMEX. However, more can be added depending on your business use case. In the UoM there is an option 'Must be Whole Number'. If this is checked, you cannot use fraction numbers in this UoM. To know more about fractions and UoMs, check out this page. The UoM list by itself only stores the name. The actual conversion rates are stored in a document called 'UoM Conversion Factor'. If you add new UoMs and plan to use it in transactions where it'll be converted to other UoMs, it is advised that you add it to this list. For example, here 1 Kg is approximately 2.2 Pounds and the exact conversion factor is stored: Unit of Measure (UoM) administrator edited 6 months ago × No Revisions Previous Next Page Settings × Route omex/ Hide on Sidebar Update Preview Discard Save Toggle Dropdown Draft Title Content Title Enter title for the new Wiki Group Submit Was this article helpful?

Few examples of UoM are Numbers (Nos), Kgs, Litre, Meter, Box, Carton etc. There are few UOMs which cannot have value in decimal places. For example, if we have television for an item, with Nos as its UoM, we cannot have 1.5 Nos. of television, or 3.7 Nos. of computer sets. The value of quantity for these items must be whole number. You can configure if particular UoM can have value in decimal place or no. By default, value in decimal places will be allowed for all the UOMs. To restrict decimal places or value in fraction for any UoM, you should follow these steps.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Inventory Dimension Introduced in Version 14 Inventory dimensions in OMEX are used to track an inventory with multiple parameters. By default, OMEX allows to track an inventory using warehouses, batches, and serial numbers. If users want to track inventory with custom parameters then they can configure it using the Inventory Dimension feature. The user gets an option to select the Inventory Dimension on respective inventory documents as well in the stock ledger and stock balance report. With this feature, you can view dimension-wise stock ledger and stock balance reports. To access the Inventory Dimension list, go to: Stock > Settings > Inventory Dimension Create Inventory Dimension Create a new record and select the Reference Document which you want to use as a custom Inventory Dimension. You can select any non-child document in the reference document. Next, the user has to put the dimension name against which the system will create a custom link field in the Applicable Documents. Applicable For Documents Apply to All Inventory Documents It will be used to select the custom Dimension in the inventory-related documents. For example, the user has created Inventory Dimension with the name \"Shelf\" and enabled \"Apply to All Inventory Document Types\". Then the system will create the custom link field with the name \"Shelf\" in the inventory documents where Batch No and Serial No fields exist. Apply to Specific Document If the user wants to add Inventory Dimension to a specific document then they have to disable the checkbox \"Apply to All Inventory Document Types\" and select the respective document in the \"Applicable to Document\" field. Also if you want to add Inventory Dimension for a specific condition like for stock entry type Issue you want separate dimension as \"From Shelf\" and stock entry type Material Receipt you want separate dimension as \"To Shelf\" then that can be possible using \"Applicable Condition\" Applicable Condition only can be visible if \"Apply to All Inventory Document Types\" is disabled You can also use the \"Type of Transaction\" with options such as Inward or Outward for a condition. Use of Inventory Dimension Once the Inventory Dimension is created system will create the custom field in respective documents User gets an option to select the Inventory Dimension in the respective transaction. For example, if the user has added Inventory Dimension as \"Shelf\" in the Stock Entry Detail document. Then in the stock entry, the child table user gets an option to select shelf (see above image). Post submission of the stock entry system will create the stock ledgers with selected inventory dimensions. Validate Negative Stock If user has enabled the \"Validate Negative Stock\" checkbox in the inventory dimension, system will not allow to make stock transactions if the respective dimensions has negative stock in the respective warehouse. If user has tried to create the stock transaction with negative stock for the inventory dimension then system will throw the below error Stock Balance and Stock Ledger Report Users can able to filter the Stock Balance and Stock Ledger report using Inventory Dimension With this feature, users can able to see Inventory Dimension wise available quantity Stock Balance Report Stock Ledger Report Note: User can only use the stock reconciliation with inventory dimensions to enter opening values and they can't use the stock reconciliation to modify the available stock or the valuation. Since we are not maintaining inventory dimensions wise valuation rate there is not sense to allow to modify valuation rate through stock reconciliation. in case if they tried to update the quantity or valuation rate through stock reconciliation, system will throw the below error Inventory Dimension administrator edited 6 months ago × No Revisions Previous Next Page Settings × Route omex/ Hide on Sidebar Update Preview Discard Save Toggle Dropdown Draft Title Content Title Enter title for the new Wiki Group Submit Was this article helpful?

Review changes Pricing In the stock module of OMEX, item pricing plays a vital role in managing the cost and selling price of items. Each item in the system can have a defined purchase price, which reflects the cost incurred to acquire the item. OMEX allows businesses to set different pricing levels based on factors such as currency, customer groups, or pricing rules. This flexibility enables businesses to implement diverse pricing strategies, such as volume discounts, promotional pricing, or tiered pricing based on customer relationships. Effective item pricing in OMEX helps businesses maintain accurate cost calculations, optimize profit margins, and tailor pricing strategies to meet customer needs and market demands.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Price Lists A Price List is a collection of Item Prices either Selling, Buying, or both. OMEX lets you maintain multiple Selling and Buying Item Prices using Price Lists. Price Lists can be used in scenarios where you have different prices for different zones (based on the shipping costs), for different currencies, etc. An Item can have multiple prices based on customer, currency, region, shipping cost, etc, which can be stored as different rate plans. In OMEX, all the Item Prices are stored separately. Buying Price for an item is different from Selling Price and thus they're stored separately. To access a Price List go to: Home > Selling/Buying/Stock > Items and Pricing > Price List 1. How to use a Price List Price Lists will be used when creating an Item Prices to track selling or buying price of an item. Specific countries can be assigned in the Price List. To disable specific Price List, untick the 'Enabled' checkbox. Disabled Price List will not be available for selection in the Sales and Purchase transactions. Price Not UOM Dependent: Consider an item, Tomatoes which you buy in Boxes and sell in Kilos. 1 Box = 10 Kilos and 1 Kilo buying price is 10rs. If this Box is unchecked and you select 1 Box in your transaction, the price will show up only for a Kilo since that's the only Item Price saved. Now, if you tick this checkbox and make a transaction with a Box of Tomatoes, then the price will be automatically set as 100 since the price of 1 Box (10 Kilos) is 100. * Standard Buying and Selling Price Lists are created by default. Note: If you have multiple Price Lists, you can select a Price List or tag it to a Customer (so that it is auto-selected). Your Item Prices will automatically be updated from the Price List.

How to use a Price List": "Price Lists will be used when creating an Item Prices to track selling or buying price of an item.\nSpecific countries can be assigned in the Price List.\nTo disable specific Price List, untick the 'Enabled' checkbox. Disabled Price List will not be available for selection in the Sales and Purchase transactions.\nPrice Not UOM Dependent: Consider an item, Tomatoes which you buy in Boxes and sell in Kilos. 1 Box = 10 Kilos and 1 Kilo buying price is 10rs. If this Box is unchecked and you select 1 Box in your transaction, the price will show up only for a Kilo since that's the only Item Price saved.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Item Price Item Price is the record in which you can log the selling and buying rate of an item. 1. How to create Item Price There are two ways to reach a new Item Price form: Selling/Buying/Stock > Items and Pricing > Item Price > New. Or Stock > Item > Click on \"+\" next to Item Price. 2. Select the Item. The name, UoM and description will be fetched. 3. Select the Price List whether Selling/Buying price or any other price list you may have created. 4. Enter the actual rate in the Rate field. 5. Save. 1.1 Selecting the Price List You can create multiple Price Lists for one Item in OMEX to track Selling and Buying Price of an Item separately. Also if the Item's selling prices change based on Territory or due to other criteria, you can create multiple Selling Price Lists for it. On selection of Price List, its currency and applicability whether for selling/buying or both will be fetched as well. To have Item Price fetching in the sales or purchase transaction, you should have 'Price List' selected in the transaction under Currency and Price List. To check all Item Prices together, go to: Stock > Stock Reports > Item Price Stock Visit the Price Lists page to know more. 2. Features 2.1 Unit of Measurement (UOM) A price is always specific to a certain UOM. For example, $1 per KG or $80 per hour. By default, the Item Price will fetch the item's Default Unit of Measure. You can change it to any UOM from the item's UOM table. For example, if Rice is sold in 1 KG and 500 grams packets, then you can mention the UOM (\"KG\" or \"grams\") in the Item Price, and the correct price will be applied based on the UOM selected in the transaction. 2.2 Packing Unit This is the quantity that must be bought or sold per unit of measure. For example, if Packing Unit is two, and UOM is one, two items in quantity will be transacted. The default is 0, you can use non-integer UoM like 1.5Kg Oats for 1 Packing Unit. If you leave it as 0, it'll not affect any transaction. 2.3 Minimum quantity This is the minimum quantity of items to be transacted for this price to be applicable and updated in the Item Price list. 2.4 Applying Price List to a specific Customer/Supplier If you select a Selling Price list, a customer field will appear where you can assign this Item Price to a specific customer. Likewise, if you select a Buying Price List, a Supplier field will appear where you can select a specific Supplier 2.5 Applying Price List to a specific Batch You can also link a specific batch to an Item Price and on the selection of that batch in the transaction, the item price for that specific batch will be applied. 2.6 Validity There are two fields here—'Valid From' and 'Valid Upto'. Valid from is set to the date you created the Item Price, you can also set the Valid Upto date on which the Item Price will expire. 2.7 Lead Time in days The approximate number of days it takes the product to reach the warehouse. You can set different Item Prices based on how much time the same product will reach you from different vendors. 2.8 Note You can add any note about the Item Price in this field. 3. Video 4.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Pricing Rule A Pricing Rule defines the discount/pricing rules that apply based on set conditions. A Pricing Rule has many options using which you can control the pricing of an Item. Filters like quantity, date, groups, and other conditions can be set. A Pricing Rule is somewhat similar to a Tax Rule. Following are the few cases which can be addressed using Pricing Rule: As per a promotional sale policy, if the Customer purchases more than 10 units of an item, he enjoys 20% discount. For Customer \"XYZ\", the selling price for the specific Item should be updated as ###. Items categorized under specific Item Group have same selling or buying price. Customers belonging to specific Customer Group should get ### selling price, or % of Discount on Items. Supplier categorized under specific Supplier Group should have ### buying rate applied. To have Discount and Price List Rate for an Item auto-applied, create Pricing Rules for it. To access the Pricing Rule list, go to: Home > Accounting > Pricing Rule 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Pricing Rule, it is advisable to create the following first: Item Item Group Customer Supplier 2. How to create a Pricing Rule Go to the Pricing Rule list and click on New. Set a title for the rule. Select what to Apply On from Item Code, Item Group, Brand, or Transaction. Select whether you want to apply Price discount or Product discount. If you want to give free products then select the product discount. For a single item, select Item Code and select the items. If you want Pricing Rule to be applied on all the items, select 'Item Group' and select All Item Group (parent Item Group). Set the discount/price to be applied. To know more, go to this section. Save. 2.1 Additional options when creating a Pricing Rule Warehouse Setting a Warehouse here will cause the Pricing Rule to be applied only if the Item is selected from the Warehouse specified here. Apply Rule On Based on the attribute selected in the 'Apply On' field, you can set the Pricing Rule based on one of these: Item Item Group Brand Transaction (on the total amount of the transaction) In this table, you can select the specific Item/Item Group/Brand. For example, if you select Apply On 'Item Group' and select 'Raw Materials' in the table, this Pricing Rule will be applied only on Items that belong to the Group 'Raw Materials'. UoM: The Pricing Rule will apply only if the UoM set here matches with the transaction. Condition In this field you can add a condition in python to check against field values in the transaction doctype, like shown below for Sales Invoice: customer=='Customer Name' and status!='Overdue' Please note that only single line python conditions will work, using fieldnames of the target doctype. Mixed Conditions If you select two or more Items and set the Min and Max Quantity. The Pricing Rule will be applied only if the total sum of Items matches the set quantities. For example, you create a Pricing Rule on Item 1 and Item 2 and set the Min and Max Quantity as 30, the Pricing Rule will apply only if the total quantity is 30. Is Cumulative Enabling this options allows the Pricing Rule to be applied cumulatively. You need to set the 'Min Amt' and 'Max Amt' for this. Consider a scenario where the Min Amt is 1,500 and Max Amt is 2,000. Now, if one transaction is created for 1,400 then Pricing Rule will not be applied. However, on creating a second invoice of amount 600, Pricing Rule will be applied. This happened since the total (cumulative) amount of the invoices added up to 2,000. Note that the discount will be applied only to the latest transaction that crosses the cumulative limit. This can be useful to give discounts if a Customer buys an Item multiple times and you want to reward him with discounts/special prices. 3. Features 3.1 Apply Rule On Other This feature checks condition on first Item but applies rule on another Item. For example, set Item1 and Item2 in the 'Apply Rule On' table and set 'Apply Rule On Other' on Item3. Now, if the transaction has Item1, Item2, and Item3, the Pricing Rule will apply on Item3 since the first two Items were present in the transaction. 3.2 Party Information Set whether the Pricing Rule is for Selling of Buying the Item. Based on your selection you can set applicability to one of the following masters. Customer Customer Group Territory Sales Partner Campaign Supplier Supplier Group 3.3 Quantity and Amount Specify minimum qty, maximum qty, minimum amount, or maximum amount of an Item when this Pricing Rule should be applied. Note that if the quantity or amount falls short or exceeds the limits set here, the Pricing Rule will not be applied at all. However, it will be applied if you have enabled the options Mixed Conditions or Cumulative. 3.4 Validity You can also set a date interval for when the Pricing Rule will be valid. This is useful for a sales promotion. On leaving the dates blank the Pricing Rule will not have any time frame limit. 3.5 Margin Margin Type: When selling an Item, you may sell it for a certain margin. If you don't want to add selling prices to Items every time and would like to automatically set a margin, it can be done with this feature. Margin Rate or Amount: The margin set can be based on Percentage or Amount, eg: 5% margin or $50 fixed margin. Read adding margin for more details. 3.6 Price Discount Scheme The actual rule to be applied is set in this section. Rate: This will be the new rate for an Item. For example, if you sell an Item for 100 and want to sell it for 112 for a specific party, then select Rate and set the Rate as 112. Discount Percentage: A specific discount percentage can be set. The discount percentage can be set to a specific Price List. Leaving the 'For Price List' blank will apply the Pricing Rule to all Price Lists. Discount Amount: A fixed discount amount will be applied. For example if you sell an Item for 100 and want to sell it with a discount of 7, then this condition can be set using the Discount Amount option. 3.7 Advanced Settings Threshold for Suggestion: This is the threshold based on which the system will notify you to adjust Item Quantity for discount. For example, if the Min Quantity is 10 and the Threshold is 9, the system will notify to add 1 more Item for the discount to be applicable. This also applies to the amount set. Priority: Consider an Item Group, you want to set specific rules on one Item from the group. This can be done by creating a new Pricing Rule and setting a higher priority. This can also apply to Customer Group and Supplier Group. Apply Multiple Pricing Rules: To understand this, consider an Item of Rate 500. There are two Pricing Rules on it P1 and P2. P1 applies 10% discount and P2 applies 5%. Enabling this option will apply a total of 15% on the Item Rate which gives 425. Apply Discount on Rate: The discount will be compounded. Consider the same scenario as above. On enabling this option, 10% will be applied on 500 which will give 450, then 5% will be applied on 450 which will give 427.5. Validate Applied Rule: Shows the entered validation message if the discount/rate set manually by you in a transaction does not match the Pricing Rule. This is useful when the top distributor in the hierarchy decides the discount/rate to be applied and you are only validating if the Pricing Rule is applied correctly. 4. Pricing Rule Discount Types 4.1 Price Discount Under the Margin Type, you can set whether the margin is calculated as a percentage or an amount. Eg: 10% margin on supplier price list at the time of sales. Rate mentioned in Pricing Rule will be given priority over Item's Price List (Item Price) rate. Discount Percentage can be applied for a specific Price List (Selling or Buying). To apply it for both, leave the 'For Price List' field blank. Discount can also be set in terms of amount. 4.2 Product Discount \"Buy 2 quantities get 1 free quantity of the same item.\" To configure such type of rules, set the Price or Product Discount as 'Product discount', tick the Same Item checkbox, and set the quantity. \"Buy 2 quantities get 1 free quantity of the another item.\" To configure such type of rules. Set the Price or Product Discount as Product discount, untick the 'Same Item' checkbox and set the 'Free Item' and quantity. New Feature - Don't Enforce Free Item Qty By default, OMEX enforces the Product Discount rules without any exceptions. Imagine a scenario where a Pricing Rule is set which says that for one item, five quantity of another item will be given for free. However, it is possible that you may only have 3 quantity of that item in stock instead of 5. With this default behaviour when you try to edit the quantity or remove the free item and try to save the document, the free item will be refetched again in the child table rendering you effectively unable to submit that document as an error citing insufficent stock will be thrown. Since free items are usually at discretion of the seller, a new option called \"Don't Enforce Free Item Qty\" has been introduced for Pricing Rule. When you have this option enabled, OMEX will fetch the free items only for the first time the item is added. You will then be free to edit the quantity of the free item or remove it entirely. The free item will no longer be fetched again when you save the document. 5.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Auto Creation of Material Request To prevent stockouts, you can track item's reorder level. When stock level goes below reorder level, purchase manager is notified and instructed to initiate purchase process for the item. In OMEX, you can update item's Reorder Level and Reorder Qty in the Item master. If same item has different reorder level, you can also update warehouse-wise reorder level and reorder qty. With reorder level, you can also define what should be the next action. Either new purchase or transfer from another warehouse. Based on setting in Item master, purpose will be updated in the Material Request as well. When item's stock reaches reorder level, Material Request is auto-created automatically. You can enable this feature from: Stock > Setup > Stock Settings A separate Material Request will be created for each item. User with Purchase Manager's role will receive email alert about these Material Requests. If auto creation of Material Request is failed, User with Purchase Manager role will be informed about error message. One of the most encountered error message is: An error occurred for certain Items while creating Material Requests based on Re-order level. Date 01-04-2016 not in any Fiscal Year. One of the reason of error could be Fiscal Year as well. Click here to learn more about it. Note: The system creates a material request by comparing the projected quantity of the group warehouse with the reorder level. If the group warehouse is not set, then the system compares the projected quantity of the Request for Warehouse with the reorder level. If the projected qty is more than the reorder level then system doesn’t add that item in the material request.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Stock Entry A Stock Entry lets you record Item movement between Warehouses. To access the Stock Entry list, go to: Home > Stock > Stock Transactions > Stock Entry Stock Entries can be made for the following purposes: Material Issue: If the material is being issued to someone in or outside the company (Outgoing Material). The Items will be deducted from the Warehouse set under Source Warehouse. Material Receipt: If the material is being received (Incoming Material). The Items will be added to the Warehouse set under Target Warehouse. Material Transfer: If the material is being moved from one internal Warehouse to another. Material Transfer for Manufacturing: If raw materials are being transferred for manufacturing. The transfer can happen against a Work Order or a Job Card. To know more, visit the Bill Of Materials page. Material Consumption for Manufacture: There can be multiple consumption stock entries against a manufacturing Work Order. Refer this link for more details Manufacture: If the Material is being received from a Manufacturing/Production Operation. Repack: If the Original item/items are being repacked into new item/items. Send to Subcontractor: If the Material is being issued for a sub-contract activity. This entry is made from a Purchase Order. To know more, visit the subcontracting page. To know more in detail about the stock entry purpose, visit this page. 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Stock Entry, it is advised that you create the following first: Warehouse Item 2. How to create a Stock Entry Stock Entries for Manufacturing purposes are usually created from a Work Order. To create a Stock Entry manually for other purposes, follow these steps: Go to the Stock Entry list, click on New. Select the Stock Entry Purpose from the ones listed above. If you set the Default Source or Target Warehouses, they'll be automatically filled for the rows in the Items table. Source/Target Warehouses will be available as per the Stock Entry Purpose you selected. Select Items and enter a quantity. The basic rate will be fetched and the amount will be calculated automatically. Save and Submit. Usually, \"Source Warehouse\" and \"Target Warehouse\" both are set for recording a movement. 2.1 Additional options when creating a Stock Entry Work Order: If this is a Manufacturing entry, the Work Order will be shown in this field. Edit Posting Date and Time: Will allow you to edit the Stock Entry's date and time. Inspection Required: If a Quality Inspection needs to be performed on the Items before submitting the Stock Entry. From BOM: If this is a Manufacturing entry, the associated BOM for the Item being manufactured will be shown. 2.2 Stock Entry Type You can also create a Stock Entry Type where only the name will be different, for example 'Scrap Entry'. The purpose will be Material Transfer but the name will be different. This is useful if you want certain Users to have access only to specific actions related to stock. 3. Features 3.1 The Items table Details about the Item, Rate, Quantity, etc. will be shown here. Ticking on 'Allow Zero Valuation Rate' will allow submitting the Purchase Receipt even if the Valuation Rate of the Item is 0. This can be a sample item or due to a mutual understanding with your Supplier. Different Source and Target Warehouses can be set for different Items. 3.2 Scrap and Process Loss Scrap Item: Scrap items are the by-product and can be treated as products. The scrap items will have the valuation rate and they will be added to the scrap warehouse. Users can set the valuation rate for the scrap item manually in the Basic Rate field. Process Loss: Process Loss has no impact on the stock, this will reduce the number of FG Items. Check the below image, the user has planned to produce 100 FG Items but after the manufacturing process, the quantity has been produced as 80. To produce 80 FG Items, the user has used all raw material quantity. So here 20 quantity has been produced so therefore the system has marked it as Process Loss Qty. The process loss cost of 20 quantities has been added to the 80 quantities of FG Item. 3.3 Additional Costs If the stock entry is an incoming entry i.e any item is receiving at a target warehouse, you can add related additional costs (like Shipping Charges, Customs Duty, Operating Costs, etc) associated with the process. The additional costs will be considered to calculate the Valuation Rate of the items. To add additional costs: Select the Expense Account to which the expense from this Stock Entry will be recorded. Enter the description and amount of the cost in the Additional Costs table. The added Additional Costs will be distributed among the receiving items (where the Target Warehouse mentioned) proportionately based on the Basic Amount of the items. And the distributed additional cost will be added to the basic rate of the item, to calculate Valuation Rate. Quantity and Rate is shown as follows when you expand the Items table. 3.4 Accounting Dimensions You can tag different transactions based on different dimensions. By default, Projects can be considered as a dimension as it is a common practice to track costs of different projects. To know more about Accounting Dimensions, visit this page. 3.5 Printing Settings Letterhead You can print your Purchase Receipt on your company's letterhead. Know more here. Print Headings Purchase Receipt headings can also be changed when printing the document. You can do this by selecting a Print Heading. To create new Print Headings go to: Home > Settings > Printing > Print Heading. Know more here. 3.6 More Information Is Opening: If this entry is the opening stock entry for the Items. Remarks: Any additional remarks about the Item. Percentage Transferred: The percentage of Items transferred depending on Stock Entry purpose. Total Amount: The total amount of Items transferred. 3.7 Perpetual Inventory If the perpetual inventory system is enabled, additional costs will be booked in Expense Account mentioned in the Additional Costs table . 3.8 After Submitting After submitting a Stock Entry, you can go to the stock ledger or the accounting ledger from the dashboard. 4. Add to Transit If you want to transfer materials from one warehouse to another and you want to make two entries for that then use \"Add to Transit\" feature. To use \"Add to Transit\" feature, make stock entry with type as \"Material Transfer\" and enable \"Add to Transit\" checkbox. Next you need to select the source warehouse from where you want to issue the material and then select the warehouse of type \"Transit\" in the target warehouse. To make transit warehouse you can goto the Warehouse master and select the warehouse type as \"Transit\". After that add items in the stock entry which needs to be transfer and submit it. To make second stock entry at the destination warehouse, users has two options. Either they can open the Original Stock Entry and click on \"End Transit\" or they can create new stock entry and click on \"Get Items From\" -> \"Transit Stock Entry\". System will fetch items from the original stock entry with the source warehouse (Transit warehouse) same as traget warehouse from the original stock entry. User has to set the target warehouse and save. 5. How to update a Stock Entry Once a stock entry is submitted, it can be updated by cancelling and amending the entry 6. Video 5.

If you set the Default Source or Target Warehouses, they'll be automatically filled for the rows in the Items table. Source/Target Warehouses will be available as per the Stock Entry Purpose you selected. Select Items and enter a quantity. The basic rate will be fetched and the amount will be calculated automatically. Save and Submit. Usually, \"Source Warehouse\" and \"Target Warehouse\" both are set for recording a movement. 2.1 Additional options when creating a Stock Entry Work Order: If this is a Manufacturing entry, the Work Order will be shown in this field. Edit Posting Date and Time: Will allow you to edit the Stock Entry's date and time. Inspection Required: If a Quality Inspection needs to be performed on the Items before submitting the Stock Entry. From BOM: If this is a Manufacturing entry, the associated BOM for the Item being manufactured will be shown. 2.2 Stock Entry Type You can also create a Stock Entry Type where only the name will be different, for example 'Scrap Entry'. The purpose will be Material Transfer but the name will be different. This is useful if you want certain Users to have access only to specific actions related to stock. 3. Features 3.1 The Items table Details about the Item, Rate, Quantity, etc. will be shown here. Ticking on 'Allow Zero Valuation Rate' will allow submitting the Purchase Receipt even if the Valuation Rate of the Item is 0. This can be a sample item or due to a mutual understanding with your Supplier. Different Source and Target Warehouses can be set for different Items. 3.2 Scrap and Process Loss Scrap Item: Scrap items are the by-product and can be treated as products. The scrap items will have the valuation rate and they will be added to the scrap warehouse. Users can set the valuation rate for the scrap item manually in the Basic Rate field. Process Loss: Process Loss has no impact on the stock, this will reduce the number of FG Items. Check the below image, the user has planned to produce 100 FG Items but after the manufacturing process, the quantity has been produced as 80. To produce 80 FG Items, the user has used all raw material quantity. So here 20 quantity has been produced so therefore the system has marked it as Process Loss Qty. The process loss cost of 20 quantities has been added to the 80 quantities of FG Item. 3.3 Additional Costs If the stock entry is an incoming entry i.e any item is receiving at a target warehouse, you can add related additional costs (like Shipping Charges, Customs Duty, Operating Costs, etc) associated with the process. The additional costs will be considered to calculate the Valuation Rate of the items. To add additional costs: Select the Expense Account to which the expense from this Stock Entry will be recorded. Enter the description and amount of the cost in the Additional Costs table. The added Additional Costs will be distributed among the receiving items (where the Target Warehouse mentioned) proportionately based on the Basic Amount of the items. And the distributed additional cost will be added to the basic rate of the item, to calculate Valuation Rate. Quantity and Rate is shown as follows when you expand the Items table. 3.4 Accounting Dimensions You can tag different transactions based on different dimensions. By default, Projects can be considered as a dimension as it is a common practice to track costs of different projects. To know more about Accounting Dimensions, visit this page. 3.5 Printing Settings Letterhead You can print your Purchase Receipt on your company's letterhead. Know more here.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Accounting Of Inventory Stock The value of available inventory is treated as a Current Asset in the company's Chart of Accounts. To prepare a Balance Sheet, you should make the accounting entries for those assets. There are generally two different methods of accounting for inventory. 1. Auto/Perpetual Inventory In this process, for each stock transaction, the system posts relevant accounting entries to sync stock balance and accounting balance. This is the default setting in OMEX for new accounts. By default, Perpetual Inventory is enabled in the Company. When you buy and receive items, those items are booked as the company’s assets (stock-in-hand). When you sell and deliver those items, an expense (Cost of Goods Sold) equal to the landed cost of the items is booked. General Ledger entries are created after every stock transaction. As a result, the value as per Stock Ledger always remains the same with the relevant account balance. This improves the accuracy of the Balance Sheet and the Profit and Loss statement. Read Perpetual Inventory documentation to check accounting entries for a particular stock transaction. 1.2 Advantages of Perpetual Inventory Perpetual Inventory system will make it easier for you to maintain the accuracy of the company's asset and expense values. Stock balances will always be synced with relevant account balances, so no more periodic manual entry needs to be done to balance them. In case of new back-dated stock transactions or cancellation/amendment of an existing transaction, all the future Stock Ledger entries and GL Entries will be recalculated for all items of that transaction. The same is applicable if any cost is added to the submitted Purchase Receipt later through the Landed Cost Voucher. Note: Perpetual Inventory completely depends upon the item valuation rate. Hence, you have to be more careful entering the valuation rate while making any incoming stock transactions like Purchase Receipt, Material Receipt, or Manufacturing/Repack. 2. Periodic Inventory In this method, accounting entries need to be created manually in order to sync stock balance and relevant account balance. The system does not create accounting entries automatically for assets at the time of material purchases or sales. In an accounting period, when you buy and receive items, an expense is booked in your accounting system. You sell and deliver some of these items. At the end of an accounting period, the total value of items to be sold, need to be booked as the company’s assets, often known as stock-in-hand. The difference between the value of the items remaining to be sold and the previous period’s stock-in-hand value can be positive or negative. If positive, this value is removed from expenses (Cost of Goods Sold) and is added to assets (stock-in-hand). If negative, a reverse entry is passed. This complete process is called Periodic Inventory. If you are an existing user using Periodic Inventory and want to use Perpetual Inventory, you need to follow a few steps to migrate. 3.

Review changes Shipment A Shipment is a document that keeps track of real-world Shipments created against a Delivery Note or independently. Introduced in version 13 Shipments are particularly useful for shippers who want to track all their Shipment information such as AWB Number, Shipment Status, Carrier, etc. within OMEX. To access the Shipment list, go to: Home > Stock > Stock Transactions > Shipment 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Shipment, it is advised that you create the following first: Company and Customer Address with Postal Code, Email Address and Phone Number set. Customer Contact. 2. How to create a Shipment A Shipment can be created manually or from a Delivery Note: 2.1. Manual Shipment To create a Shipment manually, follow these steps: Go to the Shipment list, click on New. Select an option in the Pickup from field. On selecting one of the three options, you will be prompted to select a Company/Supplier/Customer based on your selection. If you select 'Company' in the Pickup from field, along with the Address you must also select a Pickup Contact Person who will be a user from your organization, in OMEX. Make sure the Last Name, Email Address and Phone Number are set for this user. You can similarly fill the Delivery To section. Add Shipment Parcel Information in the Shipment Parcel table. Fill in the Value of Goods. Select a Pickup Date. Add a Description of Contents in this Shipment. You can optionally fill the Shipment Information section if you are tracking Shipments manually. Save and Submit. 2.1. Shipment from Delivery Note To create a Shipment from a Delivery Note: Click on Create > Shipment in the Delivery Note. Fill the form as mentioned in the previous section. 3. Features 3.1. Shipment Parcel You can specify the length, width, height and, weight of a parcel in the Shipment.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Pick List A Pick List is a document that indicates which items should be taken from your inventory to fulfill orders. This is particularly useful for shippers with a large amount of inventory, volume of orders, or customers ordering many Stock Keeping Unit(SKU). Pick list selects Warehouse where an Item is available on FIFO (First-In-First-Out) basis. Selection of Warehouse for a batched item is different. In case of batched items, Warehouse where the batch is nearer to its expiry will be selected. To access Pick List, go to: Home > Stock > Stock Transactions > Pick List 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Pick List, it is advised that you create the following first: Stock Item Warehouse 2. How to create Pick List Go to the Pick List list, click on New. Set the Company. Select the Purpose of Pick List. These are the options under Purpose: Delivery: This option will let you add Items from a Sales Order, to deliver. After submitting Pick List a new Delivery Note can be created based on the Warehouse from which items were picked. Material Transfer for Manufacture: This will let you select a Work Order from which raw materials will be pulled for picking. You will be presented with an option to select the number of finished goods for which you want to pick raw materials. After picking the stock you can create Stock Entry for the picked items i.e., raw materials. Material Transfer: This will let you select a Material Request for which you want to pick items. After picking the stock you can create a Stock Entry for the picked items. Add Item and the quantity you want to pick in the Item Locations table. Click on Get Item Locations to get the Warehouse and other details for each Item. Parent Warehouse: If a parent Warehouse is selected, Warehouses only under that parent Warehouse will be suggested. Get Item Locations: Once items to be picked is finalized you can click on the Get Item Locations button to get Warehouse selection for each item. Since Warehouse will be automatically fetched if you get an Item from any reference document, this button can be useful to manually add additional Items or change the quantity of existing Items in the Item Locations table. Item Locations: This will have the information of the item location (Warehouse), Serial Number for serialized items and batch no for batched items. If Serial Numbers are involved, the Item row will look like this: 8. Save and Submit. 2.1 Create Pick List from a Sales Order Go to a Sales Order. Click on the Create button on the top right of the form and then click the Pick List option. Once you click Pick List, all the data required for Pick List will be fetched from the Sales Order. Alternatively, you can create a new Pick List and click on \"Get Items\". This would show a popup of all pending Sales Orders. You should be able to see the Item Locations Table with the Warehouse selected for each item. Save this document and it can be used for stock picking by the person performing this activity. Submit the document once the stock picking is done and picked item quantities are updated in the document. Note: > > - Pick list can only be created for Sales Orders which has '% picked' < 100 > - A Delivery Note can be created only if the Pick List is submitted. 2.2 Create Pick List from a Work Order Go to a Work Order. Click Create Pick List button. You'll see the dialog box asking for the quantity of Finished Goods Item. This is required to calculate the number of raw material items required to manufacture the entered quantity of Finished Goods Item. You should be able to see the Item locations table with the Warehouse selected for each raw material item. Save this document and then this document can be forwarded to the person who is picking the stock. Submit the document once the stock picking is done and the picked item is updated in the document accordingly. Note: > > - Pick list can only be created for Work Orders that are still in the state of 'Not Started' or 'In Progress'. > - A Stock Entry can be created only after the Pick List is submitted. 2.3 Create Pick List from Material Request Go to a Material Request. Click on Create button and then click Pick List option. You should be able to see the Item Locations table with the Warehouse selected for each item in Material Request. Save this document and then this document can be forwarded to the person picking the stock. Submit the document once the stock picking is done and the picked item is updated in the document accordingly. Note: > > - Only Material Requests with type 'Material Transfer' can be used for Pick List creation. > - A Stock Entry of type 'Material Transfer' can be created after the Pick List is submitted. 3. Features 3.1. Update Current Stock If a Pick List is outdated, there could be a shift in stock availability by the time a Delivery Note or Stock Entry is created against it. Clicking Update Current Stock will update the quantities and warehouses in the Item Locations table. Note: This button is visible as long as there are no Delivery Notes or Stock Entries against the Pick List. 3.2 Barcode Scanning Pick list supports barcode scanning, introducing two check boxes. Scan Mode, and Prompt Qty. Scan Mode: Scan Mode in OMEX's Pick List feature is designed to streamline and verify the item-picking process in a warehouse or store environment. When using Scan Mode, users can scan barcodes on items to confirm that they are picking the correct products according to the Picklist. This mode is particularly useful for ensuring accuracy and efficiency during the picking process. Prompt Qty: When enabled, instead of incrementing the scanned items qty by 1, a dialog will prompt the user to enter a qty to increment by. 4. Pick Manually In the pick list, if a user manually selects batches, the system overrides the changes upon saving the pick list. To solve this issue added a checkbox 'Pick Manually' in the pick list. If this checkbox is enabled, the system will not override the user's changes in the pick list. 5.

    "title": "Purchase Receipt",
    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Purchase Receipt Purchase Receipts are made when you accept Items from your Supplier usually against a Purchase Order. You can also accept Purchase Receipts directly without the need for a Purchase Order. To do this, set Purchase Order Required as “No” in Buying Settings. To access the Purchase Receipt list, go to: Home > Stock > Stock Transactions > Purchase Receipt 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Purchase Receipt, it is advised that you create the following first: Purchase Order Note: From version-13 onwards we have introduced immutable ledger which changes the rules for cancellation of stock entries and posting backdated stock transactions in OMEX. Learn more here. 2. How to create a Purchase Receipt A Purchase Receipt is usually created from a Purchase Order. In the Purchase Order, click on Create > Purchase Receipt. To create a Purchase Receipt _manually_ (not recommended), follow these steps: Go to the Purchase Receipt list, click on New. The Supplier name and the Items can be fetched from the Purchase Order by clicking on 'Get Items from > Purchase Order'. You can set the Accepted Warehouse for all items in this Purchase Receipt. This is fetched if set in Purchase Order. In case any Items are defective, set the Rejected Warehouse where those Items will be stored. Select the Item and enter the quantity in the Items table. The rate will be fetched and the amount will be calculated automatically. You can expand the item row to change the Accepted Warehouse for an Item. Save and submit. You can also add a 'Supplier Delivery Note' to the Purchase Receipt if your Supplier has added some notes. Using the 'Edit Posting Date and Time' checkbox you can edit the posting time and date of the Purchase Receipt. By default, the date and time are set when you click on the New button. Is Return: Tick this checkbox if you're returning Items that were not accepted to your Warehouse. 2.1 Statuses These are the statuses a Purchase Receipt can be in: Draft: A draft is saved but yet to be submitted to the system. To Bill: Yet to be billed using a Purchase Invoice. Completed: Submitted and received all the Items. Return Issued: All the Items have been returned. Cancelled: Cancelled the Purchase Receipt. Closed: The purpose of the Close is to manage short-closing. For example, you ordered 20 qty, but closing at 15 qty. The remaining 5 is not to be received or billed. 3. Features 3.1 Currency and Price List The currency of the Purchase Receipt is shown in this section, it is fetched from the Purchase Order. The item prices will be fetched from the set Price list. Ticking on Ignore Pricing Rule will ignore the Pricing Rules set in Accounts > Pricing Rule. Since the incoming Item affects the value of your inventory, it is important to convert it into your base currency if you have ordered in another Currency. You will need to update the Currency Conversion Rate if applicable. Read about Price Lists and Multi-Currency Transactions to know more. 3.2 Warehouse details The following Warehouses set will apply to all Items in the Items table of the Purchase Receipt. You can change the Warehouses for individual Items via the table. Accepted Warehouse: This is the Warehouse in which you'll accept and store the incoming Items. Usually, this is the 'Stores' Warehouse. Rejected Warehouse: This is the Warehouse in which you'll keep the rejected Items which were either defective or not up to the quality mark. Subcontracting Raw Materials Consumed: In case you're subcontracting, select 'Yes' to consume the Raw Materials from the vendor. Read Subcontracting to know more. 3.3 Items table Barcode: You can track Items using barcodes. Scan Barcode: You can add Items in the Items table by scanning their barcodes if you have a barcode scanner. Read documentation for tracking items using barcode to know more. The Item Code, name, description, Image, and Manufacturer will be fetched from the Item master. Received and Accepted: Set the received, accepted and rejected quantity. The UoM is fetched from the Item master. You will need to update the “UOM Conversion Factor” if your Purchase Order for an Item is in a different Unit of Measure (UOM) than what you stock (Stock UOM). Rate: The Rate is fetched if set in the Price List and the total Amount is calculated. Item Tax Template: You can set an Item Tax Template to apply a specific Tax amount to this particular Item. To know more, visit this page. The Item Weight details per unit and Weight UOM are fetched if set in the Item master. Warehouse and Reference: You can set the accepted and rejected Warehouses and also add a Quality Inspection, see next section. Serial No, Batch No, and BOM: If your Item is serialized or batched, you will have to enter Serial Number and Batch in the Items table. You are allowed to enter multiple Serial Numbers in one row (each on a separate line) and you must enter the same number of Serial Numbers as the quantity. There are separate fields for entering Serial Numbers of both accepted and rejected Items here. A Batch Number can also be set if you're storing a batch of plastic medicines for example. Ticking on 'Allow Zero Valuation Rate' will allow submitting the Purchase Receipt even if the Valuation Rate of the Item is 0. This can be a sample item or due to a mutual understanding with your Supplier. You can link a BOM here if the Item is being subcontracted. Linking the BOM here will affect the Stock ledger, i.e. the raw material stock will be deducted from the Supplier Warehouse. Note: The Item has to be serialized or batched for these features to work. If the Item is serialized a popup will appear where you can enter the Serial Numbers. Accounting Dimensions help to tag each transaction with different Dimensions without the need for creating new Cost Centers. You need to create Accounting Dimensions first, to know more, visit this page. Page Break will create a page break just before this item when printing. 3.4 Tracking Quality Inspection If for certain Items, it is mandatory to record Quality Inspections (if you have set it in your Item master), you will need to update the “Quality Inspection\" field. The system will only allow you to “Submit” the Purchase Receipt if you update the “Quality Inspection”. After enabling Inspection Criteria in the Item form for Purchase and attaching a Quality Inspection Template there, Quality Inspections can be recorded in Purchase Receipts. To know more, visit the Quality Inspection page. 3.5 Raw Materials Consumed The Consumed Items table contains the Raw Materials consumed by the Supplier in order to receive the Finished Item. The Get Current Stock button will fetch the current stock of the Consumed Items from the Supplier Warehouse. 3.6 Taxes and Valuation The Taxes and Charges will be fetched from the Purchase Order. Visit the Purchase Taxes and Charges Template page to know more about taxes. The total taxes and charges will be displayed below the table. To add taxes automatically via a Tax Category, visit this page. Make sure to mark all your taxes in the Taxes and Charges table correctly for an accurate valuation. Shipping Rule A Shipping Rule helps set the cost of shipping an Item. The cost will usually increase with the distance of shipping. To know more, visit the Shipping Rule page. 3.7 Additional Discount Any additional discounts to the whole order can be set in this section. Read Applying Discount for more details. 3.8 More Information The Status of the Purchase Receipt is shown here and at the top. The various statuses are: Draft, To Bill, Completed, Canceled, and Closed. This section also shows % Amount Billed, i.e. the percentage of amount for which Sales Invoices are created. 3.9 Printing Settings Letterhead You can print your Purchase Receipt on your company's letterhead. Know more here. 'Group same items' will group the same items added multiple times in the items table. This can be seen when your print. Print Headings Purchase Receipt headings can also be changed when printing the document. You can do this by selecting a Print Heading. To create new Print Headings go to: Home > Settings > Printing > Print Heading. Know more here. 3.10 After Submitting A Stock Ledger Entry is created for each Item adding the Item in the Warehouse by the “Accepted Quantity” If you have rejections, a Stock Ledger Entry is made for each Rejection. The “Pending Quantity” is updated in the Purchase Order. After submitting the Purchase Receipt, the following can be created: Purchase Return Stock Entry Purchase Invoice Retaining Sample Stock 3.11 Returning a Purchase Order Once you've received a Purchase Order using a Purchase Receipt, you can create a return entry in case the Item needs to be returned to the Supplier. To know more, visit the Purchase Return page. 3.12 Skipping Purchase Receipt If you don't want to create a Purchase Receipt after a Purchase Order and directly want to create a Purchase Invoice, enable the feature for it in Buying Settings. Changing the value of Items post Purchase Receipt: Sometimes, certain expenses that add to the total of your purchased Items are known only after a while. Common example is, if you are importing the Items, you will come to know of Customs Duty, etc only when your “Clearing Agent” sends you a bill. If you want to attribute this cost to your purchased Items, you will have to use the Landed Cost Voucher. Why “Landed Cost”? Because it represents the charges that you paid when it landed in your possession. 4.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Packing Slip A packing slip is a document that lists the items in a shipment. It is usually attached to the goods delivered. From a single Delivery Note, multiple Packing Slips can be created. It is useful when the shipment is packed in different boxes. Each box can have a weight and number of Items it contains. For example, if you're shipping 20 chairs in 4 boxes, each box can contain 5 chairs with different Packing Slips for each box. To access the Packing Slip list, go to: Home > Stock > Tools > Packing Slip Note: In order to create Packing Slips from a Delivery Note, the Delivery Note needs to be in the Draft stage. 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Packing Slip, it is advised that you create the following first: Delivery Note 2.

A Putaway Rule is uniquely defined for an Item-Warehouse combination in a Company. It takes Warehouse Capacity and Priority into consideration. In Purchase Receipts and Stock Entries (Material Receipt & Material Transfer), the Putaway Rules are applied and Items are auto-assigned to Warehouses based on the given strategy. This is particularly useful for capacity management in large Warehouses with multiple locations. To access a Putaway Rule, go to: Home > Stock > Stock Transactions > Putaway Rule 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Putaway Rule, it is advised that you create the following first: Stock Item Warehouse 2. How to create a Putaway Rule Go to the Putaway Rule list, click on New. Set the Company and Select an Item. Select the Warehouse on which this rule is applicable. Set the Capacity. You can also select a UOM if you want to set the Capacity in a different UOM. The Capacity in Stock UOM will be set automatically. Set the Priority. This can begin from 1 onwards, 1 being the highest priority. Save. You can additionally Disable a Putaway Rule as well. The rule is unique to each Item-Warehouse combination. 3. How Putaway is strategized Here the strategy is purely based on Capacity and Priority. Warehouses will be auto-assigned until they reach full capacity. Priority will be considered first. Followed by free space. If two rules have the same priority, the rule with more free space available will be assigned. If you are running at full capacity (no free space in any Warehouse), OMEX will let you know. 4. How it works As mentioned before, the Putaway Rules are applied on Purchase Receipts and Stock Entries (Material Receipt & Material Transfer). A checkbox called Apply Putaway Rule will allocate items to Warehouses based on the Putaway Rules. Putaway Rules are applied on checking this checkbox. They are also re-applied on save if this checkbox is enabled. Let us see the same in action: Here is a Purchase Order with a requirement of 5 Cartons (60 Nos) of Mineral Water. Two active Putaway Rules have been created below with capacity 4 Cartons (48 Nos) each. One has a higher priority than the other. A Purchase Receipt is created from this Purchase Order. On checking Apply Putaway Rule, one row of 5 Cartons is split and assigned according to the rules. First, 4 out of 5 Cartons are accommodated in the 'Finished Goods - UPI' Warehouse. Once this Warehouse is at capacity, it assigns the rest (1 Carton) to the 'Stores - UPI' Warehouse. 5. Warehouse Capacity Summary The Warehouse Capacity Summary Report shows Warehouse capacities and their respective stock levels. Only Warehouses having Putaway Rules will be listed here. The Edit Capacity button gives provision to edit the Putaway Rule capacity. 6. Types of Putaway Application 6.1. Direct Putaway The example in the previous section explains Direct Putaway. It is, essentially, directly assigning incoming stock to certain Warehouses based on a strategy. This can easily be exercised via a Purchase Receipt. 6.2. Indirect (Combined) Putaway Stock is often received into temporary or staging Warehouses first. From here it is placed into appropriate locations within the Warehouse. This is called Indirect or Combined Putaway. To simulate this within OMEX, a simple Purchase Receipt can be created into the temporary Warehouse, without Putaway applied. From here, a Stock Entry (Material Transfer) can be done, where Putaway Rules can be applied similar to Purchase Receipts. 7.

Review changes Stock Reconciliation Stock Reconciliation is the process of counting and evaluating material/products, periodically at the year end. This is done in order to: Keep the actual physical stock count and book stock count in sync Value the stock for preparation of the accounting statements The Stock Reconciliation feature in OMEX is used for: Posting opening stock Reconciling book and actual stock To access the Stock Reconciliation list, go to: > Home > Stock > Tools > Stock Reconciliation 1. How to Create a Stock Reconciliation to Post Opening Stock Using stock reconciliation you can update the number of specific items in a warehouse as of specific time. You can also add Items in the stock which have Serial Numbers or the Batch Numbers. Go to the Stock Reconciliation list, click on New. Select the Purpose as 'Opening Stock'. You can edit the posting Date and Time. Select Item Code, Warehouse, Quantity, and Valuation Rate. If there is a Serial / Batch No involved, add it. If you want to auto-generate Serial No / Batch No then keep those fields blank. For auto-generation of Serial No, you need to set \"Serial Number Series\" in the Item master. For auto-generation of Batch no, you need to enable \"Automatically Create New Batch\" checkbox in the item master. The Difference Account will be set as 'Temporary Opening'. Save and Submit. Note: Maintain Stock option should be enabled in Item master for this to work. 2. How to Create a Stock Reconciliation to Reconcile Book and Physical Stock Count Stock Reconciliation is the process of counting and evaluating stock-in-trade, periodically and at year-end in order to value the total stock for preparing accounting statements. In this process, the actual physical stocks are checked and recorded in the system. The actual stocks and the stock in the system should be in agreement and accurate. If they are not, you can use the Stock Reconciliation tool to reconcile stock balance and value with actuals. To reconcile the stock: Go to the Stock Reconciliation list, click on New Select the Purpose as 'Stock Reconciliation'. You can edit the posting Date and Time. Set Item Code, Warehouse. The current Quantity and Valuation Rate will be fetched, change the quantity as required. The expense account in Difference Account will be set to 'Stock Adjustment' by default. The Cost Center default will be 'Main', change if needed. Save and Submit. 3. Features 3.1 Upload Data Through Spreadsheet If you have a lot of items, you can upload the details via a spreadsheet. Download Template Open new Stock Reconciliation and click on Download button to download the template in CSV format. 2. Enter Data in CSV Template. The CSV format is case-sensitive. Do not edit the headers which are pre-set in the template. In the Item Code and Warehouse column, enter exact Item Code and Warehouse as created in your OMEX account. For quantity, enter the stock level you wish to set for that item, in a specific warehouse. 3. Upload the CSV file with the data by clicking on 'Upload' button. 4. Review, Save and Submit. 5. Check Stock Ledger Report for updated stock balance. 3.2 Get Stock Balance and Valuation as of Specific Date and Time You can import the stock balance and valuation as of specific date and time from a selected Warehouse by clicking on Items button. You can update the Quantity and Valuation Rate as needed. 3.3 Using barcode scanner to scan physical inventory If you have configured barcodes for your items you can use a barcode scanner to reconcile physical quantities. To do this follow these steps: Set default warehouse Enable \"Scan Mode\" this will disable fetching existing quantity and let you add quantities by incrementally scanning items. Click on \"Scan Barcode\" field and use your barcode scanner to send input. Reconciliation items table will will keep getting updated as you scan items. Following video demonstrates this process. 4. How Stock Reconciliation Works Once a stock reconciliation is posted to update the quantity on specific date and time for an item in a warehouse, it will not be modified by subsequent stock transactions even if such transactions have a posting date which is prior to the stock reconciliation date. In other words, backdated entries will not change the stock numbers after a Stock Reconciliation entry is posted. Examples are as follows. 4.1 For non-serialized Items Consider an item with code 'ABC001' in a 'Mumbai' warehouse. Let's assume that stock as on 10th January is 100 units. Stock Reconciliation is made on 12th January to set stock balance to 150 units. Stock Ledger would look as shown below: | Posting Date | Qty | Balance Qty | Voucher Type | | 10/01/2014 | 100 | 100 | Purchase Receipt | | 12/01/2014 | 150 | 150 | Stock Reconciliation | If a new Purchase Receipt entry is made on 5th January 2014, which is prior to the date of Stock Reconciliation entry, Stock Ledger would look as shown below. <table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\"> Posting Date Qty Balance Qty Voucher Type 05/01/2014 20 20 Purchase Receipt 10/01/2014 100 120 Purchase Receipt 12/01/2014 150 Stock Reconciliation As you can see, the Balance Qty as on 10th January got updated from 100 to 120. But the Balance Qty as on 12th January did not get updated from 150 to 170. ### 4.2 For Serialized Items For an Item, ITEM-00225 that has has the 6 serial nos HJF00020, HJF00021, HJF00022, HJF00023, HJF00024, HJF00025 with valuation rate as 530 per serial no. At the end of the year, the user has come to know that they have only 3 Serial Nos against that item with Valuation Rate 620. So to remove the old serial nos HJF00020, HJF00021, HJF00022, HJF00023, HJF00024, HJF00025 and add the new serial nos with new Valuation Rate, Stock Reconciliation can be used as follows: Select the item ITEM-00225 in the stock reconciliation, on the selection of the Item the system will auto pull the existing serials nos. Then set Qty as 3, Valuation Rate as 530 and serial no as HJF00026, HJF00027, HJF00028. Before reconciliation, the valuation rate was 530 and the available qty was 6, so the total stock value was 3,180. After reconciliation, the valuation rate has changed to 620 and available qty changed to 3, so the new stock value becomes 1,860. To adjust the stock value in the accounting, the system has credited extra amount 3,180 - 1,860 = 1,320 to Warehouse's account and debited to stock adjustment account. The GL entries for the above entry is as follows: To view GL entries, click on button View > Accounting Ledger The stock balance after submission of the stock reconciliation: The general ledger for the warehouse account Nagpur after submission of the stock reconciliation: ### 4.3 For Batch Items Stock reconciliation for batch items will be used to add a new batch or to update the quantity of the existing batch. For example, the batch JHGJH00003 has the current quantity as 60 but if the user wants to make it 100 then by using stock reconciliation, user can update the batch quantity. Batch-Wise Balance History report after submission of the stock reconciliation: 5. Serial and Batch Bundle In version 15 the serial and batch bundle feature has introduced to make stock transaction against the serial no / batch items. For stock reconciliation, user gets two option to make serial and batch bundle. Use Serial / Batch Fields: The user can use the old serial / batch fields to make serial and batch bundle automatically. In this case user has to enable the checkbox \" Use Serial No / Batch Fields\" in the line item Use Serial / Batch Bundle: The user can use the Serial / Batch bundle to make stock reconciliation for serialized / batched items. Here user gets option to either \"Reconcile All Serial Nos / Batches\" or \"Reconcile Selected Serial Nos / Batches\" + **Reconcile Selected Serial Nos / Batches:** The user needs to disable the \"**Reconcile All Serial Nos / Batches**\" checkbox and create a serial and batch bundle for specific serial numbers or batches. By doing this, the system will automatically create the Current Serial / Batch Bundle for the serial numbers or batches which has been selected by the user manually within the Serial and Batch Bundle. For example, if the user has 10 batches and wants to change the valuation rate of only 2 batches, then the user should disable the \"Reconcile All Serial Nos / Batches\" checkbox, and create the serial and batch bundle for those 2 batches with the new valuation rate. + **Reconcile All Serial Nos / Batches:** The user needs to enable the checkbox \"**Reconcile All Serial Nos / Batches**\" and create a serial and batch bundle. For example, if the user has 10 batches and wants to reconcile and keep only one batch. Using the stock reconciliation, the user will be able to consume 9 batches automatically and retain one batch. For that, the user has to enable the \"Reconcile All Serial Nos / Batches\" checkbox in the Stock Reconciliation Item, and then the system will automatically consume 9 batches and add one batch on submission of the stock reconciliation. 6.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Perpetual Inventory As per the perpetual inventory system, accounting entry is done for every stock transaction. Otherwise, it's done in larger intervals for example monthly or quarterly. Each warehouse is linked with a corresponding account head. On receipt of items in a particular warehouse, the balance in the Warehouse Account will increase. Similarly, when items are delivered from the Warehouse, an expense will be booked, and the balance in the Warehouse Account will reduce. 1. How to activate perpetual inventory Activate Perpetual Inventory: Home > Accounting > Company > Enable Perpetual Inventory Note that if you disable perpetual inventory, users will have to manage the account entries manually. Set up the following default accounts for each Company if not set. These accounts are created automatically in the new OMEX accounts. Default Inventory Account (Asset) Stock Received But Not Billed (Liability) Stock Adjustment Account (Expense) Expenses Included In Valuation (Expense) Cost Center If the user wants to set an individual account for each warehouse, create account head for each account. Go to: Accounts > Chart of Accounts > Company > Application of Funds (Assets) > Current Asset > Stock Assets > Create a new account with same name as Warehouse Now, go to a warehouse and link this account to the warehouse. This helps in filtering and viewing statements warehouse-wise. For stock transactions, general ledger entries made against the Account Head set on the warehouse, if the user had not set the account for the warehouse then the system gets the account head from the parent warehouse. If Account was not set for parent warehouse then the system gets the account(Default Inventory Account) from the company master. 2. Example Consider the following Chart of Accounts and Warehouse setup for your company: Chart of Accounts: Assets (Dr) Current Assets Accounts Receivable Debtors Stock Assets Stores Finished Goods Work In Progress Tax Assets VAT Liabilities (Cr) Current Liabilities Accounts Payable Creditors Stock Liabilities Stock Received But Not Billed Tax Liabilities Service Tax Income (Cr) Direct Income Sales Account Expenses (Dr) Direct Expenses Stock Expenses Cost of Goods Sold Expenses Included In Valuation Stock Adjustment Indirect Expenses Shipping Charges Customs Duty 2.1 Warehouse - Account Configuration Stores Work In Progress Finished Goods 2.2 Purchase Receipt Suppose you have purchased _10 nos_ of item \"RM0001\" at _$200_ from supplier \"Arcu Vel Quam Fabricators\". Following are the details of Purchase Receipt: Supplier: Arcu Vel Quam Fabricators Items: Item Warehouse Qty Rate Amount Valuation Amount RM0001 Stores 10 200 2000 2250 Taxes: Account Amount Category Shipping Charges 100 Total and Valuation VAT (10%) 200 Total Customs Duty 150 Valuation Stock Ledger General Ledger As stock balance increases through Purchase Receipt, \"Store\" accounts are debited and a temporary account \"Stock Receipt But Not Billed\" account is credited, to maintain double-entry accounting system. At the same time, the negative expense is booked in account head having category as \"Valuation\" or \"Total and Valuation\" in taxes and charges table for the amount added for valuation purpose, to avoid double expense booking. 2.3 Purchase Invoice On receiving Bill from supplier, for the above Purchase Receipt, you will make Purchase Invoice for the same. The general ledger entries are as follows: General Ledger Here \"Stock Received But Not Billed\" account is debited and nullified the effect of Purchase Receipt. 2.4 Delivery Note Let's say, you have an order from \"Utah Automation Services\" to deliver 5 nos of item \"RM0001\" at $300. Following are the details of Delivery Note: Customer: Utah Automation Services Items: Item Warehouse Qty Rate Amount RM0001 Stores 5 300 1500 Taxes: Account Amount Service Tax 150 VAT 100 Stock Ledger General Ledger As an item is delivered from \"Stores\" warehouse, \"Stores\" account is credited and an equal amount is debited to the expense account \"Cost of Goods Sold\". The debit/credit amount is equal to the total valuation amount (buying cost) of the selling items. And the valuation amount is calculated based on your preferred valuation method (FIFO / Moving Average) or actual cost of serialized items. In this example, we have considered the valuation method as FIFO. Valuation Rate = Purchase Rate + Charges Included in Valuation = 200 + (250 / 10) = 225 Total Valuation Amount = 220 * 5 = 1125 2.5 Sales Invoice with Update Stock Let's say, you did not make Delivery Note against the above order and instead, you have made Sales Invoice directly, with \"Update Stock\" options. The details of the Sales Invoice are same as the above Delivery Note. Stock Ledger General Ledger Here, apart from normal account entries for an invoice, \"Stores\" and \"Cost of Goods Sold\" accounts are also affected based on the valuation amount. 2.6 Stock Entry (Material Receipt) Items: Item Target Warehouse Qty Rate Amount RM0001 Stores 50 220 11000 Stock Ledger General Ledger 2.7 Stock Entry (Material Issue) Items: Item Source Warehouse Qty Rate Amount RM0001 Stores 10 220 2200 Stock Ledger General Ledger 2.8 Stock Entry (Material Transfer) Items: Item Source Warehouse Target Warehouse Qty Rate Amount RM0001 Stores Work In Progress 10 220 2200 Stock Ledger General Ledger 3.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Landed Cost Voucher Landed Cost is the final total cost associated with a product for it to reach the buyer’s doorstep. Landed costs include the original cost of the item, complete shipping costs, customs duties, taxes, insurance, currency conversion fees, etc. All of these components might not be applicable in every shipment, but relevant components must be considered as a part of the landed cost. What is Landed Cost? To understand landed cost better, let’s take an example based on our daily lives. You need to purchase a new washing machine for your home. Before making an actual purchase, you probably do some research to know the best price. In this process, you often found a better deal from a store which is long away from your home. But you should also consider shipping cost while buying from that store. Total cost including shipping might be more than the price you get in your nearby store. In that case, you will choose to buy from your nearest store, as the landed cost of the item is cheaper in the nearest store. Similarly in business, identifying landed cost for an Item/product is very crucial, as it helps to decide selling cost of that item and impacts the company’s profitability. Hence all applicable landed cost charges should be included in Item’s valuation rate. According to the Third-Party Logistics Study, only 45% of the respondents stated that they use Landed Cost extensively. The main reasons of not using Landed Cost were unavailability of necessary data (49%), lack of right tools (48%), insufficient time (31%), and not sure how to apply landed cost (27%). To access the Landed Cost Voucher list, go to: > Home > Stock > Tools > Landed Cost Voucher 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using Landed Cost Voucher, it is advised that you create the following first: A Purchase Receipt or Purchase Invoice with Update Stock enabled. This is your original receipt of goods. A Purchase Invoice for the landed costs (e.g. Freight, Insurance, etc.) We will then use the Landed Cost Voucher to decrease the costs recorded through the second Purchase Invoice and increase the stock value. 2. How to create a Landed Cost Voucher Go to the Landed Cost Voucher list, click on New. Select Receipt Document Type whether Purchase Invoice or Receipt. You can select multiple documents. Select the specific Invoice or Receipt. The supplier name and Grand Total will be fetched automatically. Click on the Get Items from Purchase Receipts button to fetch the item details from the Purchase Invoice/Receipt. Select whether Distribute Charges Based On should be on quantity or Amount. Enter the Expense Account and the Amount for Additional Costs in the Taxes and Charges table. The amount will be distributed equally based on the quantity or amount as per your selection. Save and Submit. In the document, you can select multiple Purchase Receipts/Invoices and fetch all items from those Purchase Receipts. Then you should add applicable charges in “Taxes and Charges” table. You can easily delete an item if the added charges do not apply to that item. The added charges are proportionately distributed among all the items based their amount or quantity. If you selected based on the amount, the Item with the highest amount will be allocated the highest proportion of the charges. In case of quantity, Item with the highest quantity will be allocated most of the charges and the other Items will be allocated lesser amounts. This is shown in the following screenshot: 3. Related Actions 3.1 Adding Landed Cost in the Purchase Receipt itself In OMEX, you can add landed cost-related charges in “Taxes and Charges” table while creating Purchase Receipt (PR). You should add those charges for “Total and Valuation” or “Valuation” in the 'Consider Tax or Charge for' field. Charges which are payable to the same Supplier from whom you are buying the items should be tagged as “Total and Valuation”. Otherwise, if applicable charges are payable to a 3rd party, it should be tagged as “Valuation”. On submission of Purchase Receipt, the system will calculate the landed cost of all items, considering those charges. This landed cost will be considered to calculate the item’s Valuation Rate (based on FIFO / Moving Average method). But in reality, while making Purchase Receipt we might not know all the charges which are applicable for landed cost. Your transporter can send the invoice after 1 month, but there is no point in waiting for booking Purchase Receipt till then. Companies that import their products/parts, pay a huge amount as Customs Duty. And generally, they get invoices from the Customs Department after a while. In these cases, “Landed Cost Voucher” becomes handy, as it allows you to add those additional charges on a later date, and to update landed cost of purchased items. 3.2 What happens on submission? Valuation Rate of items is recalculated based on new landed cost. If you are using “Perpetual Inventory”, the system will post general ledger entries to correct Stock-in-Hand balance. It will debit (increase) corresponding “warehouse account” and credit (decrease) Expense Account mentioned in Taxes and Charges table. If items are already delivered, the Cost-of-Goods-Sold (CoGS) value has been booked as per the old valuation rate. Hence, general ledger entries are reposted for all future outgoing entries of associated items, to correct CoGS value. 4.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Quality Inspection In OMEX, you can mark your incoming or outgoing products for Quality Inspection. To access this feature go to: Home > Stock > Tools > Quality Inspection 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Quality Inspection, it is advised that you do the following first: Create an Item. Enable Quality Inspection Criteria in the Item master. On enabling either checkboxes, submission of a stock delivery/receipt document will be allowed only after a Quality Inspection is done against it: (Optional) Create a Quality Inspection Template. You can add inspection parameters and acceptance criteria in the template, which can be easily fetched into any Quality Inspection. After saving the template, you can set this template in the Item Master (as shown above). 2. How to create a new Quality Inspection From a Draft Purchase/Subcontracting Receipt or Delivery Note, go to the Item table's Quality Inspection field and click on Create a New Quality Inspection. You can also create a Quality Inspection for Job Card in order to monitor the quality of in-process items. In this case, you can create a Quality Inspection for the Production Item in Job Card. Select the inspection type whether Incoming (Purchase), Outgoing (Sales), or In Process (Manufacturing). Select the Reference Document Type whether Purchase Receipt, Purchase Invoice, Delivery Note, Sales Invoice, Stock Entry, or Job Card. Select the Item and set the sample size which will be inspected. Note that only Items having Inspection Criteria enabled in the Item master, will be fetched. The Quality Inspection Template set in the Item master will be fetched. You can change who it's inspected by and also add who it's verified by. Any additional Remarks about the Inspection can be added. Save. Set the Status. Submit. 3. Features A single Quality Inspection consists of many Quality Checks (Parameters) within it. Each of these checks could be Numeric, Non-numeric or Formula Based. 3.1 Numeric Quality Checks Numeric Quality Checks include all checks that require number-based readings and acceptance criteria. E.g. checking if a reading is in a certain range. By default the checks are numeric. There are two fields: Minimum Value and Maximum Value, to define a range that each reading must be in. These fields can be set in the Quality Inspection Template once and be simply fetched into the Quality Inspection. If any of the readings entered are not within this range, the status on the row will be set to 'Rejected' automatically on Save. 3.2 Non-numeric (Value-Based) Quality Checks Non-numeric Quality Checks include checks that require alphabetical values or those that do not require any mathematical calculations. E.g. checking if the color is white in a color quality check, Yes/No values for certain parameters, etc. For Non-numeric checks, enable the 'Non-numeric' checkbox. You will notice the field Acceptance Criteria Value and the section Value-Based Inspection are visible. Enter the field Reading Value. The Acceptance Criteria Value can be set in the Quality Inspection Template once and then be fetched into the Quality Inspection. If the Reading Value does not match the Acceptance Criteria Value, the status on the row will be set to 'Rejected' automatically on Save. 3.3 Formula-Based Quality Checks Formula-Based Quality Checks are useful for more complex scenarios where just specifying a range or an acceptance value is not enough. E.g. checking if the grade of a material is A/B/C, checking if the mean of some readings is within a certain range, etc. Formula-Based Quality Checks are applicable to Numeric and Non-numeric Quality Checks. Enable the 'Formula Based Criteria' checkbox to perform a Formula-Based Quality Check. You will then notice a field called Acceptance Criteria Formula where you can specify a formula that determines whether a certain check is Accepted or Rejected. This formula can be set in the Quality Inspection Template once and then be fetched into the Quality Inspection. This formula depends on the many Reading fields in the Readings table. For Numeric readings, reading_1, reading_2 and so on are accepted in the formula. For Non-numeric readings, only reading_value is accepted in the formula. Here are some examples of formulas: # Numeric (reading_1 + reading_2) < 10 # sum of both readings is less than 10 (reading_1 + reading_2) <= 10 # sum of both readings is less than or equal to 10 mean < 15 # mean of non empty numeric readings is less than 15 (reading_1 * 2) < 20 # Reading 1 multiplied by 2 is less than 20 (reading_1) / 2 < 20 # Reading 1 divided by 2 is less than 20 # Non-numeric reading_value in (\"A\", \"B\", \"C\") # Reading Value is either A / B / C reading_value != \"Red\" # Reading Value is not equal to Red Update the readings and Save. The Status field in the Readings table rows is set automatically based on the formula for acceptance. 3.3 Manual Inspection So far, all the Quality Checks have automatic acceptance/rejection on Save. In the real world, there could be cases where a check is rejected but yet will be accepted because there is some tolerance. Such cases will require the user to determine the row-level status. To avoid any system interference in such checks, enable the 'Manual Inspection' checkbox. You can now set the status manually and it will be untouched on Save. Here Reading 1 is outside the defined range, this check would be rejected. But, since it is not very far from 0.153 we accept it manually. The status for the entire Quality Inspection can then be decided by the user. 4. Video 5.

Review changes Stock Inspection Quality inspection in OMEX stock module involves assessing and ensuring the quality of incoming and outgoing inventory items. When items are received into stock, quality inspectors can perform inspections based on predefined criteria such as physical condition, specifications, or regulatory standards. Inspection results can be recorded, and items can be accepted, rejected, or placed on hold based on the inspection outcome. During outgoing transactions such as sales or transfers, quality inspections can be conducted to verify that items meet specified quality standards before being shipped or transferred. OMEX facilitates the creation of inspection criteria, inspection plans, and inspection certificates to streamline the quality control process.

    "title": "Serial Number",
    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Serial Number Allow Negative Stock has removed for Serial / Batch Items from version 15. So from version 15 users won't be able to make negative stock transactions for serial /batch items even though Allow Negative Stock has enabled in the Stock Settings. As discussed in the Item page, if an Item is serialized, a Serial Number (Serial No) record is maintained for each quantity of that Item. This information helps track the location of the Serial No, its warranty and end-of-life (expiry) information. You can also track from which Supplier you purchased the Serial No and to which Customer you have sold it. The Serial No status will tell you its current inventory status. If your Item is serialized you will have to enter the Serial Nos in the related column with each Serial No in a new line. You can maintain single units of serialized items using Serial Number. To access the Serial Number list, go to: > Home > Stock > Serial No and Batch > Serial No 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Serial Number, it is advised that you create the following first: Item Enable 'Has Serial No' in the Item master 2. How to create a Serial Number Usually, Serial Numbers are auto-created when transactions are made against a serialized Item. This works only when 'Has Serial No' is enabled and a series is set in the Item master. For example, a series was set for the following Item as 'PB2L.#####'. Then a Stock Entry was submitted to receive the Item. The Serial Numbers were created accordingly. However, if you want to create a Serial No manually follow these steps: Go to the Serial Number list, click on New. Enter a Serial Number. Enter the Item Code and details will be fetched. If any transaction is done with an item, Serial No cannot be set or unset. Save. Inventory of an Item can only be affected if the Serial No is transacted via a Stock transaction (Stock Entry, Purchase Receipt, Delivery Note, Sales Invoice). When a new Serial No is created directly, its Warehouse cannot be set. 2.1 Notes about Serial Number The Status is set based on Stock Entry. Only Serial Numbers with status 'Available' can be delivered. Serial Nos can automatically be created from a Stock Entry or Purchase Receipt. If you mention Serial No in the Serial Nos column, it will automatically create those serial Nos. If in the Item Master, the Serial No Series is mentioned, you can leave the Serial No column blank in a Stock Entry / Purchase Receipt. Serial Nos will automatically be set from that series. 3. Features 3.1 Purchase/Manufacture details The document from which the Serial No was created will be shown. If you purchased it from a Supplier, it'll be linked here. 3.2 Delivery Details If the Serial No was generated from a Sales Order, the Customer will be linked here. 3.3 Warranty/AMC Details If the Item is under warranty or AMC (Annual Maintenance Contract), the expiry dates for these can be set. 3.4 More Information Any additional information about this specific Item unit can be set under 'Serial No Details'. 4.

This works only when 'Has Serial No' is enabled and a series is set in the Item master. For example, a series was set for the following Item as 'PB2L.#####'. Then a Stock Entry was submitted to receive the Item. The Serial Numbers were created accordingly. However, if you want to create a Serial No manually follow these steps: Go to the Serial Number list, click on New.\nEnter a Serial Number.\nEnter the Item Code and details will be fetched.\nIf any transaction is done with an item, Serial No cannot be set or unset.\nSave.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Serial Number Naming Serial Nos. is unique value assigned on each unit of an item. Serial no. helps in tracking item's warranty and expiry details. Generally high value items like machines, computers, costly equipments are serialized. To make item Serialized, in the Item master, check Has Serial No. There are two ways Serial no. can be generated in OMEX. 1. Serializing Purchase Items If purchased items are received with Serial Nos. applied by OEM (original equipment manufacturer), you can follow same Serial No in OMEX as well. While creating Purchase Receipt, you shall scan or manually enter Serial nos. for an item. On submitting Purchase Receipt, Serial Nos. will be created in the backend as per Serial Nos. provided for an item. If using OEM' Serial No., then in the Item master, Prefix should not be mentioned for serializalization. As per this scenaio, Prefix field should be left blank. If received items already has its Serial No. barcoded, you can simply scan that barcode for entering Serial No. in the Purchase Receipt. Click here to learn more about it. On submission of Purchase Receipt or Stock entry for the serialized item, Serial Nos. will be auto-generated. Generated Serial numbers will be updated for each item. 2. Serializing Manufacturing Item To Serialize Manufacturing Item, you can define Series for Serial No. Generation in the Item master itself. Following that series, system will create Serial Nos. for Item when its Production entry is made. 2.1 Serial No. Series When Item is set as serialized, it will allow you to mentioned Series for it. 2.2 Production Entry for Serialized Item On submission of production entry for manufacturing item, system will automatically generate Serial Nos. following Series as specified in the Item master.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Batch Allow Negative Stock has removed for Serial / Batch Items from version 15. So from version 15 users won't be able to make negative stock transactions for serial /batch items even though Allow Negative Stock has enabled in the Stock Settings. Batch feature in OMEX allows you to group multiple units of an Item and assign them a unique value/number/tag called Batch No. This is done based on the Item. If the Item is batched, then a Batch number must be mentioned in every stock transaction. Batch numbers can be maintained manually or automatically. This feature is useful to set the expiry date of multiple Items or move them together to different Warehouses. To access the Batch No list, go to: > Home > Stock > Serial No and Batch > Batch 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Batch, it is advised that you create the following first: Item Enable 'Has Batch No' in the Item master 2. How to create a new Batch To set item as a batch item, \"Has Batch No\" field should be checked in the Item master. If you have not selected \"Automatically Create New Batch\" when creating an Item, you will have to make Batches Manually as you go along. To create new Batch No. master for an item, go to: Go to the Batch list, click on New. Set the Batch ID. Select the Item. If any transaction is done with an item, the batch cannot be set or unset. Save. When Batches are enabled for an Item, the option to retain sample stock also becomes available. 2.1 Batch Auto Creation If you want automatic batch creation at the time of Purchase Receipt, you must tick 'Automatically Create New Batch' in the Item master: 3. Features 3.1 Splitting and Moving Batches When you open a batch, you will see all the quantities that belong to that batch on the page. To move the batch from one Warehouse to another, you can click on the Move button. You can also split the batch into smaller one by clicking on the Split button. This will create a new Batch based on this Batch and the quantities will be split between the batches. * If you set expiry date, the Batch will show 'Not Expired' until the expiry date, after which it'll show 'Expired'. If a date is not set, the Batch will show 'Not Set'. 3.2 Transacting Items with Batches A Batch master should be created before the creation of Purchase Receipt. Hence, every time a Purchase Receipt or Work Order is being made for a batch item, you will first create its Batch No, and then select it in the Purchase order or Stock Entry. On every stock transaction (Purchase Receipt, Delivery Note, Invoice) with a batch item, you should provide the Item's Batch No. Note: In stock transactions, Batch IDs will be filtered based on Item Code, Warehouse, Batch Expiry Date (compared with a Posting date of a transaction) and Actual Qty in Warehouse. While searching for Batch ID without value in the Warehouse field, Actual Qty filter won't be applied. 4.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Serial and Batch Bundle NOTE: Users must create separate \"Serial and Batch Bundles\" for each stock transaction. They cannot use the same \"Serial and Batch Bundle\" across multiple stock transactions. Allow Negative Stock has removed for Serial / Batch Items from version 15. So from version 15 users won't be able to make negative stock transactions for serial /batch items even though Allow Negative Stock has enabled in the Stock Settings. In version 15, we have introduced the Serial and Batch Bundle. This feature will be used to link Serial / Batch Nos in the Stock transactions. Before version 15 the Serial No field was a Small Text field. Which meant one column was holding more than one serial number. Because of this design, there were lot of a data integrity issues. So to solve this we have changed the Serial No field from Small Text to Link field in version 15. Since we can't add a child table inside a child table we have added a new doctype \"Serial and Batch Bundle\" to pick/dispatch multiple Serial / Batch numbers. How does this work? You need a Serial and Batch bundle to be created and linked to stock transactions whenever you have to deal with Serial / Batch numbers. The user needs to create a separate \"Serial and Batch Bundle\" for each transaction and they can't link the same \"Serial and Batch Bundle\" to multiple transactions. Auto Creation of Serial and Batch Bundle for Inward Entry If the user wants to create an auto \"Serial and Batch Bundle\" for the inward entry then they have to make sure that 'Serial Number Series' has been set for the item Serial Item and the 'Automatically Create New Batch' checkbox with 'Batch Number Series' has set for the Batch Item. For Serial No For Batch No After the configuration when the user creates the Purchase Receipt or Stock Entry with the Type \"Material Receipt\", the system will create the \"Serial and Batch Bundle\" for inward automatically on submission of the record. Auto Creation of Serial and Batch Bundle for Outward Entry If the user wants to create an auto \"Serial and Batch Bundle\" for the outward entry then they have to enable the checkbox \"Auto Create Serial and Batch Bundle For Outward\" in the stock settings. The user can also set \"Pick Serial / Batch Based On\" as \"FIFO / LIFO / Expiry\" in the stock settings. After the configuration when the user creates the Delivery Note or Stock Entry with the Type \"Material Issue\", the system will create the \"Serial and Batch Bundle\" for outward automatically on submission of the record. Manual Creation of Serial and Batch Bundle for Inward Entry For the \"Serial and Batch Bundle\", both serial / batch no needs to be present first in the system. So with the manual option user has to first create the Serial / Batch Nos in the system. The user has to use the CSV import option to make Serial / Batch Nos. The blank CSV template can be downloaded using the Serial and Batch Selector. Complete GIF for manual creation of Serial and Batch Bundle for inward entry is as follow Manual Creation of Serial and Batch Bundle for Outward Entry Using the Serial and Batch Selector, the user can pick the Serial / Batch Nos based on the \"FIFO / LIFO / Expiry\" method. Complete GIF for manual creation of Serial and Batch Bundle for outward entry is as follow History of Serial Numbers To check the history of Serial Numbers, check the report \"Serial No Ledger\" Serial / Batch Selector Is used to select Serial Nos / Batches manually, also this popup is used to create serial nos / batches automatically if they are not exists. Disable Serial / Batch Selector If users don't want to use the Serial and Batch Selector (popup) then they can disable it through Stock Settings. To disable it, goto Stock Settings > Serial and Batch Item (TAB) > \"Disable Serial No And Batch Selector\" enable this checkbox and save. Old Serial / Batch Fields Many customers have requested to retain the old serial and batch fields to address UX issues. In response to their demand, we have retained the old serial/batch fields. These fields are solely used for entering serial numbers and batches. The system will automatically create the Serial and Batch Bundle upon the submission of the stock transaction. To enable this feature, users must navigate to Stock Settings and enable the 'Use Serial / Batch Fields' option (see below image). After that when user create the stock transaction like delivery note, system will show the old Serial / Batch Fields. For more details please check the below GIF User can disable old serial / batch fields at transaction level too. Update Serial / Batch on Creation of Auto Bundle If user want to update the Serial No / Batch in the Serial / Batch fields automatically on creation of the Serial and Batch Bundle, then goto Stock Settings -> disable \"Do Not Update Serial / Batch on Creation of Auto Bundle\". Case: User has enabled \"Use Serial / Batch Fields\" in the stock settings User want to create the serial and batch bundle per single batch User has set the auto create batch in the Item master. On submission of the Purchase Receipt, system has created auto Batch, Serial and Batch Bundle and set the Batch and Serial and Batch Bundle in the respective fields on the Purchase Receipt line item.. Updating the value of batch takes time and if you want to skip this step, please enable \"Do Not Update Serial / Batch on Creation of Auto Bundle\" in the stock settings. With this the batch column remain blank but the serial and batch bundle will have the value of the auto created bundle.

Review changes Disassembly Order The 'Disassembly Order' in OMEX is used to dismantle finished goods and return the components that are in good condition back to the store. The system allows users to change the valuation rate of the components when adding them back to the store. To create the \"Disassembly Order\", open the work order which are in Completed state or Closed state. Click on create button and after that \"Disassembly Order\" Once user clicked on the \"Disassembly Order\" button, the system will open the stock entry with type as \"Disassemble\" Users can manually removed items which are not in a good condition The system, by default, fetches the basic rate based on past transactions. If users want, they can edit the basic rate for the raw materials.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Stock Settings You can set default settings for your stock related transactions from the Stock Settings page... 1. Item Naming By By default, the Item Name is set as per the Item Code entered. If you want Items to be named by a set Naming Series choose the 'Naming Series' option . 2. Defaults 2.1 Default Item Group This will be the default item group allocated to a newly created item. Item groups are useful for classification and setting properties for the whole group. To know more visit the Item Group page. 2.2 Default Stock UOM The default unit of measure for stock is set as numbers (Nos), it can be changed from here. 2.3 Default Warehouse Set the default Warehouse from which the stock transactions are done. This will be fetched into the Default Warehouse in the Item master: 2.4 Sample Retention Warehouse This is the Warehouse where sample retentions are stored. To know more, visit this page. 2.5 Default Valuation method FIFO - first in first out or moving average valuation for your items. The default method is FIFO. If you select Moving Average, new Items will be valuated on Moving Average. You can change this when creating new Items in the Item form. Once the Item is saved, the Valuation Method cannot be changed. Read more here. 3. Limit Percent This is the percentage you are allowed to receive or deliver more against the quantity ordered. For example: If you have ordered 100 units, Supplier sends 120 units and the percentage is set to 10% then you are allowed to receive 110 units. By default, this is set to 0. 4. Role Allowed to Over Deliver/Receive Users with this role are allowed to over deliver/receive against orders above the allowance percentage 5. Show Barcode Field A field to enter Barcode details for an item. If unticked, the field won't be visible in the Item form. 6. Convert Item Description to Clean HTML Usually, descriptions are copy-pasted from a website or Word/PDF file and they contain a lot of embedded styles. This messes up the Print view of your invoices or quotes. To fix this, you can check \"Convert Item Description to Clean HTML\" in Stock Settings. This will ensure that when you save the Items, their descriptions will be cleaned up. If you want to control your description, views, and allow any HTML to be embedded, you can uncheck this property. 7. Auto insert 7.1 Auto insert Price List rate if missing Enabling this will insert an Item Price to the Price List of an Item automatically when using the Item in its first transaction. This price is fetched from the 'Rate' set in the first transaction with the Item. The Price List depends on whether you're using a Purchase or Sales transaction. Note that, the Item Price will be automatically inserted only in the first transaction if not already present. If this is unticked, the 'Standard Selling Rate' set in the Item when creating the Item will be added as Item Price. 7.2 Automatically Set Serial Nos based on FIFO Serial numbers for stock will be set automatically based on the Items entered based on first in first out. The Serial Numbers will be set automatically in transactions like Purchase/Sales Invoices, Delivery Notes, etc. 8. Allow Negative Stock This will allow stock items to be displayed in negative values. Using this option depends on your use case. For example, the stock transaction entries are entered at the weekend or month-end. In this case, negative stock needs to be enabled so that you can continue with your purchase/sales transaction entries. Instead of enabling negative stock globally you can also enable it for specific items. Allow Negative Stock has removed for Serial / Batch Items from version 15. So from version 15, users won't be able to make negative stock transactions for serial /batch items even though Allow Negative Stock has enabled in the Stock Settings. 9. Set Qty in Transactions based on Serial No Input The quantity of items will be set according to the serial numbers. For example, if the user has added serial nos like A001, A002, and A003 then the system will set the quantity as 3 in the transaction. 10. Automatic Material Request 10.1 Raise Material Request when the stock reaches re-order level This option is useful if you want to ensure a constant supply of raw materials/products and avoid shortage. A Material Request will be raised automatically when stock reached the re-order level defined in the Item form. 10.2 Notify by Email on the creation of automatic Material Request An email will be sent to notify the User with the role 'Purchase Manager' when an automatic Material Request is created. 11. Inter Warehouse Transfer Settings 11.1 Enable customer warehouse for material transfer from Delivery Note and Sales Invoice This option is useful when material transfer needs to be presented as a Delivery Note. For example, if there are statutory requirements where taxes are to be applied on each transfer of Material. It is easier to manage in a transaction like Delivery Note, than in the Stock Entry 11.2 Enable supplier warehouse for material transfer from Purchase Receipt and Purchase Invoice Similar to above option this option is useful when material transfer needs to be presented as Purchase Receipt. To know more about inter warehouse material transfer via Delivery Note and Purchase Invoice please refer this article Material Transfer From Delivery Note 12. Freeze Stock Entries The User will not be allowed to make stock postings beyond this date. Stock Frozen Upto: A threshold date till which stocks will be frozen. Freeze Stocks Older Than [Days]: Stocks older than x days will be frozen. This is calculated based on the creation date of the item. Role Allowed to edit frozen stock: The role you choose here will be allowed to edit frozen stock. 13. Batch identification Global setting for batches of stocks to be identified by a Naming Series. You can override this in the Item DocType. 14. Allow to Edit Stock Quantity Enable \"Allow to Edit Stock UOM Qty for Sales Documents / Allow to Edit Stock UOM Qty for Purchase Documents\" in the stock settings. Why to Edit Stock Qty / Qty as Per Stock UOM If you're using multi-uom and your stock uom is a whole number, then you might face the issue that the Stock UOM should be non-decimal. Users experience this problem when they are unable to set an accurate conversion factor.. Solution User will set the Stock Quantity and system will calculate the conversion factor 15. Allow UOM with Conversion Rate Defined in Item If enabled, the system will allow selecting UOMs in sales and purchase transactions only if the conversion rate is set in the item master.

Freeze Stock Entries\nThe User will not be allowed to make stock postings beyond this date.\n \n\nStock Frozen Upto: A threshold date till which stocks will be frozen.\nFreeze Stocks Older Than [Days]: Stocks older than x days will be frozen. This is calculated based on the creation date of the item.\nRole Allowed to edit frozen stock: The role you choose here will be allowed to edit frozen stock.\n\n13. Batch identification\nGlobal setting for batches of stocks to be identified by a Naming Series. You can override this in the Item DocType.\n14. Allow to Edit Stock Quantity\nEnable \"Allow to Edit Stock UOM Qty for Sales Documents / Allow to Edit Stock UOM Qty for Purchase Documents\" in the stock settings.\n \nWhy to Edit Stock Qty / Qty as Per Stock UOM\nIf you're using multi-uom and your stock uom is a whole number, then you might face the issue that the Stock UOM should be non-decimal. Users experience this problem when they are unable to set an accurate conversion factor..\nSolution\nUser will set the Stock Quantity and system will calculate the conversion factor\n \n\nAllow UOM with Conversion Rate Defined in Item\n\nIf enabled, the system will allow selecting UOMs in sales and purchase transactions only if the conversion rate is set in the item master.\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext Stock Settings\nrohit edited 2 months ago\n\n\n×\n\n\n\n\nYou can set default settings for your stock related transactions from the Stock Settings page.\n1. Item Naming By\n \nBy default, the Item Name is set as per the Item Code entered. If you want Items to be named by a set Naming Series choose the 'Naming Series' option .\n2. Defaults\n2.1 Default Item Group\nThis will be the default item group allocated to a newly created item. Item groups are useful for classification and setting properties for the whole group. To know more visit the Item Group page.\n2.2 Default Stock UOM\nThe default unit of measure for stock is set as numbers (Nos), it can be changed from here.\n2.3 Default Warehouse\nSet the default Warehouse from which the stock transactions are done. This will be fetched into the Default Warehouse in the Item master:  \n2.4 Sample Retention Warehouse\nThis is the Warehouse where sample retentions are stored. To know more, visit this page.\n2.5 Default Valuation method\nFIFO - first in first out or moving average valuation for your items. The default method is FIFO. If you select Moving Average, new Items will be valuated on Moving Average. You can change this when creating new Items in the Item form. Once the Item is saved, the Valuation Method cannot be changed. Read more here.\n3. Limit Percent\nThis is the percentage you are allowed to receive or deliver more against the quantity ordered. For example: If you have ordered 100 units, Supplier sends 120 units and the percentage is set to 10% then you are allowed to receive 110 units. By default, this is set to 0.\n4. Role Allowed to Over Deliver/Receive\nUsers with this role are allowed to over deliver/receive against orders above the allowance percentage\n5. Show Barcode Field\nA field to enter Barcode details for an item. If unticked, the field won't be visible in the Item form.\n6. Convert Item Description to Clean HTML\nUsually, descriptions are copy-pasted from a website or Word/PDF file and they contain a lot of embedded styles. This messes up the Print view of your invoices or quotes.\nTo fix this, you can check \"Convert Item Description to Clean HTML\" in Stock Settings. This will ensure that when you save the Items, their descriptions will be cleaned up.\nIf you want to control your description, views, and allow any HTML to be embedded, you can uncheck this property.\n7. Auto insert\n \n7.1 Auto insert Price List rate if missing\nEnabling this will insert an Item Price to the Price List of an Item automatically when using the Item in its first transaction. This price is fetched from the 'Rate' set in the first transaction with the Item. The Price List depends on whether you're using a Purchase or Sales transaction.\nNote that, the Item Price will be automatically inserted only in the first transaction if not already present.\nIf this is unticked, the 'Standard Selling Rate' set in the Item when creating the Item will be added as Item Price.\n7.2 Automatically Set Serial Nos based on FIFO\nSerial numbers for stock will be set automatically based on the Items entered based on first in first out. The Serial Numbers will be set automatically in transactions like Purchase/Sales Invoices, Delivery Notes, etc.\n8. Allow Negative Stock\nThis will allow stock items to be displayed in negative values. Using this option depends on your use case. For example, the stock transaction entries are entered at the weekend or month-end. In this case, negative stock needs to be enabled so that you can continue with your purchase/sales transaction entries.\nInstead of enabling negative stock globally you can also enable it for specific items.\n\nAllow Negative Stock has removed for Serial / Batch Items from version 15. So from version 15, users won't be able to make negative stock transactions for serial /batch items even though Allow Negative Stock has enabled in the Stock Settings.\n\n9. Set Qty in Transactions based on Serial No Input\nThe quantity of items will be set according to the serial numbers. For example, if the user has added serial nos like A001, A002, and A003 then the system will set the quantity as 3 in the transaction.\n10. Automatic Material Request\n \n10.1 Raise Material Request when the stock reaches re-order level\nThis option is useful if you want to ensure a constant supply of raw materials/products and avoid shortage. A Material Request will be raised automatically when stock reached the re-order level defined in the Item form.\n10.2 Notify by Email on the creation of automatic Material Request\nAn email will be sent to notify the User with the role 'Purchase Manager' when an automatic Material Request is created.\n11. Inter Warehouse Transfer Settings\n \n11.1 Enable customer warehouse for material transfer from Delivery Note and Sales Invoice\nThis option is useful when material transfer needs to be presented as a Delivery Note. For example, if there are statutory requirements where taxes are to be applied on each transfer of Material. It is easier to manage in a transaction like Delivery Note, than in the Stock Entry\n11.2 Enable supplier warehouse for material transfer from Purchase Receipt and Purchase Invoice\nSimilar to above option this option is useful when material transfer needs to be presented as Purchase Receipt.\nTo know more about inter warehouse material transfer via Delivery Note and Purchase Invoice please refer this article Material Transfer From Delivery Note\n12.

Use Item Based Reposting This option is helpful when you want to speed up reposting. The system skips reposting for duplicate items and warehouses to improve speed. Do reposting for each Stock Transaction The system creates a reposting record for backdated entries. This means that the system only generates a reposting record if a future transaction exists for the same item and warehouse. We have seen cases where system has not created reposting entry for backdated transaction because of concurrency issues. So to solve them added this option which won't check whether the future transaction exists for the same item and warehouse to make reporting record. This is also added for an audit purpose. Notify Reposting Error to Role If reposting fails due to any issues, the system sends emails to the system managers. If you don't want to send failure emails to the system managers, you can configure a role, and the system will then send the email to the users assigned to that respective role. Note for usage Reposting is a tough computational problem to solve because it involves reposting 1000s may be 10,000s of entries depending on volume of transaction. Please use Reposting Wisely. It is recommended to limit back dated entries to not more than one month. Reposting entries with dates ranging more than one month may lead to failure in reposting for multiple reasons including but not limited to 1. Reposting Time may be limited to prevent utilisation of resources during working hours, therefore the actual reposting may come up at a later date than when it was created, therefore leading to inconsistencies in the vouchers on the system 2.

This means that the system only generates a reposting record if a future transaction exists for the same item and warehouse. We have seen cases where system has not created reposting entry for backdated transaction because of concurrency issues. So to solve them added this option which won't check whether the future transaction exists for the same item and warehouse to make reporting record. This is also added for an audit purpose.\nNotify Reposting Error to Role\nIf reposting fails due to any issues, the system sends emails to the system managers. If you don't want to send failure emails to the system managers, you can configure a role, and the system will then send the email to the users assigned to that respective role.\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext Stock Reposting Settings\nmanan edited 2 weeks ago\n\n\n×\n\n\n\n\n \nLimit timeslot for Stock Reposting\nIf you want to run the reposting in a specific time then you can enable the checkbox \"Limit timeslot for Stock Reposting\".

Review changes Closing Stock Balance Note: In v16 the closing stock balance has renamed as Stock Closing Entry How the Stock Balance Report is Prepared The Stock Balance report is a crucial tool for businesses to monitor their inventory levels and make informed decisions. It consists of four main columns: Opening Stock, In Stock, Out Stock, and Balance Stock. The Balance Stock is calculated using the formula Opening Stock + In Stock - Out Stock. One of the key challenges in preparing the Stock Balance report is the calculation of the Opening Stock. To determine the Opening Stock, the system reads all the rows in the Stock Ledger Entry table that come before the specified From Date filter. However, a potential issue arises when the filter for item code or warehouse is not set, and the Stock Ledger Entry table contains a vast number of records. This situation can significantly slow down the process and cause performance problems. Closing Stock Balance To address this issue, a solution has been introduced - the \"Closing Stock Balance\" feature. This feature allows the system to prepare the Opening Stock in advance, reducing the time taken to generate the Stock Balance report. Here's how to use the \"Closing Stock Balance\" feature effectively: Closing Stock Balance Creation: After the financial year has ended, and the necessary audits have been completed for that year (in this example, the financial year 2022-2023), you should create the Closing Stock Balance. This should be done for the specific end date of the financial year 2022-2023. Data Preparation: Once the Closing Stock Balance is submitted, the system will take some time to prepare the data. During this process, the Opening Stock values are calculated and stored for future use. Utilizing Closing Stock Balance: With the Closing Stock data prepared, the system will utilize this data to generate the Stock Balance report efficiently. Now, whenever a user opens the Stock Balance Report, the system can quickly read the necessary data from the Closing Stock Balance for the Opening Stock values. Annual Closing Stock Balance: It is essential to create the closing stock balance every year after the closing of the financial year. This ensures that the Opening Stock values are updated and accurate for each reporting period. By implementing the \"Closing Stock Balance\" feature and following the recommended steps, businesses can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of generating Stock Balance reports, even with a vast amount of data in the Stock Ledger Entry table.

Review changes Stock Reposting In OMEX If the stock ledgers have issues that result in incorrect stock quantity or valuation calculations, the 'Repost Item Valuation' feature can be used to fix this. The 'Repost Item Valuation' can be created either against an Item and Warehouse or against stock transactions such as Purchase Receipt, Delivery Note, etc. While creating a 'Repost Item Valuation', users should be aware of the financial year closing. They should avoid reposting transactions created in a closed financial year. If they do, the closing balance of the closed financial year will change. Before closing the financial year, users should conduct an audit. If they find any incorrect entries, they should use this feature to create a reposting against them. Sometimes, due to customization, the system performs a partial commit and fails to create stock ledger entries properly. In such cases, users need an option to recreate the stock ledger entries for the corresponding stock transactions.To do this, a checkbox 'Recreate Stock Ledgers' has been added to the 'Repost Item Valuation' doctype. If this checkbox enabled, the system will Recreate stock ledgers and do reposting of the future transactions if exists. This checkbox will only be visible when reposting is based on a transaction.

    "title": "Stock Adjustment / COGS with Negative Stock",
    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Stock Adjustment / COGS with Negative Stock In this, we will see how negative stock causes stock adjustments. Many users make negative stock entries in the system. For example, they create delivery notes without stock in the system by enabling the 'allow negative stock' in Stock Settings. They do this because they have to dispatch materials to their customers with the delivery receipt. To fix the negative stock, they then make a purchase receipt entry or a material receipt stock entry. Most users make the purchase entry after the delivery note date, which causes the stock adjustment entry. To understand the case take a below example Suppose there is an item 'Testing Item Stock Adj' for which stock doesn't exist. Now, the user has created the delivery note, but while making the delivery note, the user received an error that the valuation rate is mandatory. So, the user has set the random value as 100 in the valuation rate field for the item 'Testing Item Stock Adj'. Delivery Note Since the stock was not exists, system has used the valuation rate as 100 and booked the stock in hand as below Now, since the stock is in negative, we need to make a purchase entry to adjust it. So, we'll create a purchase receipt entry with a purchase rate of 300. Now the purchase receipt entry is created, but it is made after the delivery note (check the posting date and posting time of both entries). The delivery note has a valuation rate of 100, and the purchase receipt should have a valuation rate of 300 (based on the purchase cost). Since the stock was negative, the system uses the valuation rate of 100 (based on previous entry which was delivery note) for the purchase receipt entry. If the system used a valuation rate of 300, then the stock balance quantity would be zero, but the stock balance value would be 200, which is incorrect. Therefore, the system used a valuation rate of 100, and the difference of 200 is booked in the stock expense account (Stock Adjustment/COGS) as follows:. How to Solve the Problem Either don't use the negative stock feature or make the purchase entry (backdated) before the dispatch entry, so the system will fix the valuation rate of the delivery note and no adjustment entry will be needed for the purchase receipt. On submission of the above back-dated purchase entry, the system will create a reposting entry that will fix the valuation rate of the delivery note. After the reposting, the delivery note's valuation rate has changed from 100 to 300, and therefore the 'Stock In Hand' has changed to 300.

Review changes Change Valuation Method In the OMEX, users can change the valuation method from FIFO to Moving Average, but not from Moving Average to FIFO, for items with existing stock transactions. If a user changes the valuation method from FIFO to Moving Average for any item, the system will use the Moving Average method for new outward transactions. Additionally, if the user creates backdated transactions, all transactions created after that backdated entry will be reposted using the Moving Average method. This may result in changes to the closing balance value of earlier transactions.

A Routing stores all Operations along with the description, hourly rate, operation time, batch size, etc. Creating a Routing for your BOM Operations is useful when similar Operations are used for manufacturing different items. To access the Routing list, go to: Home > Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > Routing 1. Prerequisites Operation Workstation 2. How to Create a Routing Go to the Routing list, click on New. Enter a name for the Routing. Enter the Operations in the BOM Operation table: Select the Operation. The default Workstation will be fetched. Enter the Hourly Rate for running this Operation. Enter the Operation Time in minutes. Enter the Batch Size, i.e. the number of units processed in this Operation. The Operating Cost will be calculated based on the Hourly Rate and the Operation Time. Save. Once created, a Routing can be selected in a BOM to fetch the Operations stored in the Routing. 3. Sequence ID in Routing Sequence ID enforces the users to complete the operations sequentially via Job Card. In case a user tries to complete an operation before completing any of its precedent operations as per the Sequence ID, the system throws a validation error. 2.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Bill Of Materials A Bill of Materials is a list of items and sub-assemblies with quantities required to manufacture an Item. A BOM may also contain the manufacturing operations required to manufacture the Item. A Bill of Materials (BOM) is at the heart of the Manufacturing system and the most important document that will help to create other document types like Work Orders and Job Cards. OMEX supports multi-level BOM. To know more, visit this page. The BOM is a list of all materials (either bought or made) and operations that go into manufacturing a finished product or sub-assembly. In OMEX, each item (sub-assembly) could have its own BOM hence forming a tree of Items with multiple levels. To make accurate Purchase Requests, you must always maintain correct BOMs. To access the BOM list, go to: Home > Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > Bill of Materials Note that once a BOM is submitted, it cannot be edited. You can only cancel the existing, duplicate it and submit another one. A BOM is also linked to multiple places in the Manufacturing module, so making changes to it can be time-consuming and tedious. Hence it is a good practice to carefully think and fill out the BOMs before submitting. 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a BOM, it is advised that you create the following first: Item Operation Workstation Routing 2. How to create a Bill of Materials Go to the Bill of Materials list, click on New. Select the Item to be manufactured. The Item name, UoM, company, and currency will be fetched automatically. Enter the quantity of the Item that will be manufactured from this Bill of Materials. Under the Items table, select the raw materials (Items) required to manufacture the Item. Then proceed to: Select the quantity of Raw Material used. Set an Item operation here to be fetched in Work Orders later. If this Item is a sub-assembly, the default BOM for it will be fetched. Select the Source Warehouse to track inventory. Enter the scrap percentage that will remain after this raw material is used. Under the Scrap section, select the scrap Item that will be created when manufacturing and its quantity. The scrap Item can also have a Rate if it is a by-product and not waste. Skip this section if 100% of raw materials are completely utilized. If the scrap Item is the same as the Item to be manufactured, it is set as a Process Loss Item and its quantity is subtracted from the manufactured Item quantity. Save and Submit. In the Items table, you'll see an option 'Include Item in Manufacturing'. Raw Materials need to have this checkbox ticked. In case there are Operations or services you need to include in the BOM that are not necessarily an Item used for manufacturing, uncheck this checkbox. For example, treating the plastic with a chemical involves some cost but it is not an Item and the cost needs to be tracked. 2.1 Bill of Materials with Operations To add Operations tick the 'With Operations' checkbox. Now, an Operations table can be seen. This option is useful for tracking the costing of various Operations performed to manufacture the Item. Operations can be added easily by setting a template with the Routing master. In the “Operations” table, add the operations that need to be performed to manufacture this particular Item. For each operation, you will be asked to enter a Workstation where the Operation will be performed. A default Workstation can be set from the Operation document. Enter the Operating Hourly Rate, Operation Time in minutes, and the Batch Size created with the Operation. The Operating Cost will be calculated based on these values. Note: Workstations are defined only for product costing and Work Order Operations scheduling purposes not tracking inventory. Inventory is tracked in Warehouses set in the Items table of the BOM. Transfer Material Against needs to be set for a BOM With Operations. Materials can be transferred against a Work Order in bulk or individual Job Cards. Changing this affects whether the 'Material Transfer for Manufacture' is done against the Work Order at once or multiple times against the individual Job Cards. Setting this option depends on factors like time taken to manufacture the item, value of the items manufactured, number of parts used in manufacturing, the skill of your labor involved, etc. 2.2 Additional options when creating a Bill of Materials Is Active: An Item could also be manufactured using an alternate set of materials/operations. In that case, uncheck this checkbox to disable this BOM and use another one. Is Default: This BOM will be selected by default in Work Orders etc. when the Item selected. Inspection Required: This will make 'Quality Inspection' mandatory for raw materials and the finished goods. Select the Quality Inspection Template after ticking this checkbox. Allow Alternative Item: Sometimes when manufacturing a finished good, specific materials may not be available. If you tick this, you can create and select an alternative item from the Item Alternative list. For example, using plastic beads instead of plastic crystals. For more details visit this page. Allow Same Item Multiple Times: In some manufacturing cases, the same item needs to be added twice. For example, two metal pipes of length 0.5m each to form another shape. Here the quantity cannot be simply set to 2 and be done since the UoM will show 1m as total but we need 0.5m + 0.5m in the form of two pipes for production. Ticking this checkbox allows you to select the same item multiple times. Set rate of sub-assembly item based on BOM: Enabling this checkbox will set the rate of sub-assembly items based on their BOMs. If unchecked, the rate will be fetched from the Valuation Rate of the sub-assembly Item. Rate Of Materials Based On: The Rate of raw materials used can be calculated based on different parameters. Valuation Rate: The Valuation Rate set in the Item master. Last Purchase Rate: The Rate is fetched from the last Sales Order/Invoice. Price List: The Rate will be fetched from the Item Price. For more details, visit this page. 3. Features 3.1 BOM Costing The Costing section in a BOM gives an approximate cost of manufacturing the Item. The costing is calculated from the Valuation Rate of the raw materials/sub-assemblies involved and the Operation costs. In case the BOM was submitted when the costs for Items/Operations were not updated, you can update the costs using the Update Cost button. This will fetch the latest price/costs. The BOM cost can also be set to be updated automatically via Manufacturing Settings, 'Update BOM Cost Automatically' option. 3.2 Materials Required (Exploded) This table lists down all the raw materials required to manufacture an Item. It also fetches raw materials for the sub-assemblies along with the quantities. The non-exploded table will not list the raw materials required for producing the sub-assemblies. For example, to manufacture a plastic shaving brush you need some raw materials and the bristles as a sub-assembly. For the handle, you manufacture your own plastic, but for the bristles, you use raw plastic crystals. 3.2.1 Do Not Explode If user wants to exclude the exploded items then they have to enable the checkbox \"Do Not Explode\" in the BOM Item table. Use Case: Laptop Motherboard (Kept in stock) Keyboard A company manufacture the Laptop which required two sub-assembly items as Motherboard and Keyboard. The company does the manufacturing once they received the order from the customer. The Manufacturing Time required for the Motherboard is more than the Keyboard, therefore the company does the manufacturing of the Motherboard individually irrespective of the sales orders and kept in the stock. As the item Motherboard is already in stock it helps to reduce the overall Manufacturing Time of the main item Laptop. Now while preparing the BOM for the Laptop in the OMEX, they don't want to Explode the BOM of the item Motherboard but they want to Explode the BOM of the item Keyboard. Therefore we have added the checkbox \"Do Not Explode\" for the BOM Item. With this user will enable the checkbox \"Do Not Explode\" for the item Motherboard and not for the item Keyboard. 3.3 Project and Website The BOM can be linked to a Project to track progress, Project costing, etc. In case of engineer to order, every order could be a Project and the sub-assemblies would be Tasks. The completion can be tracked by linking to a Project in that case. The BOM can also be shown in the Website for Open-source hardware products. Open-source hardware is similar to open-source where the product specifications are listed publicly. 3.4 BOM Template With BOM template you can create BOMs for template items (against which you create variant items). These BOMs can be used as the default BOM while making Work Orders against the template Item's variants. You can also add the template items as raw materials in the template BOM. While making Work Order from the BOM Template, OMEX gives provision to select the Item Variant against the template Item, for more details check following screenshot. The user can also make the BOM for the variant item using the template BOM. To make the variant BOM: Go to the BOM Template. Click on Create button. Click on Variant BOM. Select the Variant Item for which you want to make the BOM. If the raw materials in the BOM is a template Item, then system gives provision to select the Item Variant. 3.5 After Submitting Once the BOM is submitted, the following document types can be created against the BOM from the Dashboard: 4.

In case the BOM was submitted when the costs for Items/Operations were not updated, you can update the costs using the Update Cost button. This will fetch the latest price/costs. The BOM cost can also be set to be updated automatically via Manufacturing Settings, 'Update BOM Cost Automatically' option.",
      "3.2 Materials Required (Exploded)": "This table lists down all the raw materials required to manufacture an Item. It also fetches raw materials for the sub-assemblies along with the quantities. The non-exploded table will not list the raw materials required for producing the sub-assemblies. For example, to manufacture a plastic shaving brush you need some raw materials and the bristles as a sub-assembly. For the handle, you manufacture your own plastic, but for the bristles, you use raw plastic crystals.",
      "3.2.1 Do Not Explode": "If user wants to exclude the exploded items then they have to enable the checkbox \"Do Not Explode\" in the BOM Item table.",
      "Use Case:": "Laptop\n\nMotherboard (Kept in stock)\nKeyboard Motherboard (Kept in stock)\nKeyboard A company manufacture the Laptop which required two sub-assembly items as Motherboard and Keyboard. The company does the manufacturing once they received the order from the customer. The Manufacturing Time required for the Motherboard is more than the Keyboard, therefore the company does the manufacturing of the Motherboard individually irrespective of the sales orders and kept in the stock. As the item Motherboard is already in stock it helps to reduce the overall Manufacturing Time of the main item Laptop.\nNow while preparing the BOM for the Laptop in the OMEX, they don't want to Explode the BOM of the item Motherboard but they want to Explode the BOM of the item Keyboard. Therefore we have added the checkbox \"Do Not Explode\" for the BOM Item. With this user will enable the checkbox \"Do Not Explode\" for the item Motherboard and not for the item Keyboard.",
      "3.3 Project and Website": "The BOM can be linked to a Project to track progress, Project costing, etc. In case of engineer to order, every order could be a Project and the sub-assemblies would be Tasks. The completion can be tracked by linking to a Project in that case. The BOM can also be shown in the Website for Open-source hardware products. Open-source hardware is similar to open-source where the product specifications are listed publicly.",
      "3.4 BOM Template": "With BOM template you can create BOMs for template items (against which you create variant items). These BOMs can be used as the default BOM while making Work Orders against the template Item's variants. You can also add the template items as raw materials in the template BOM. While making Work Order from the BOM Template, OMEX gives provision to select the Item Variant against the template Item, for more details check following screenshot. The user can also make the BOM for the variant item using the template BOM. To make the variant BOM: Go to the BOM Template.\nClick on Create button.\nClick on Variant BOM.\nSelect the Variant Item for which you want to make the BOM.\nIf the raw materials in the BOM is a template Item, then system gives provision to select the Item Variant. Go to the BOM Template. Click on Create button. Click on Variant BOM. Select the Variant Item for which you want to make the BOM. If the raw materials in the BOM is a template Item, then system gives provision to select the Item Variant.",
      "3.5 After Submitting": "Once the BOM is submitted, the following document types can be created against the BOM from the Dashboard:",

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Production Plan A Production Plan helps in production and material planning for the Items planned for manufacturing. These production items can be committed via Sales Order (to Customers) or Material Requests (internally). Production Plan helps the user to plan production against multiple Sales Orders or the Material Requests. Also, it helps in Material Procurement planning for the raw material item, based on the quantity of finished products to be manufactured. To access the Production Plan list, go to: Home > Manufacturing > Production > Production Plan 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Production Plan, it is advised that you create the following first: Item Material Request Sales Order Bill Of Materials Routing 2. How to Create a Production Plan As mentioned earlier, a Production Plan can be used for planning the manufacture of Items against Sales Orders or Material Requests. The common steps are: Go to the Production Plan list, click on New. Select whether to get items from a Sales Order or a Material Request. A Production Plan can also be created manually where you can select the Items to manufacture. 2.1 Production Against Sales Orders Select option as Sales Order from the 'Get Items From' drop-down list. The system will show the filters, using that you can pull the Sales Orders for the production. You don't need to use all these filters if you have only a few Sales Orders in a particular time frame. Click on Get Sales Orders to fetch sales orders based on the above filters. Click on 'Get Items for Work Order' to fetch the items from the above Sales Orders. Items only for which a BOM is present will be fetched. On expanding a row in the Items to Manufacture table, you'll see an option to 'Include Exploded Items'. Ticking this includes raw materials of the sub-assembly items in the production process. If \"Consolidate Items\" is ticked and saved, items with the same BOM are combined into a single item with the combined total planned quantity. 2.2 Production Against Material Requests Select option as Material Request from the Get Items From drop-down list. The system will show the filters, using that we can pull the Material Requests for the production. Click on 'Get Material Request' to fetch material requests based on the above filters. Click on Get Items for Work Order to fetch the items from the above material requests. 2.3 Planning for Material Requests Clicking on the 'Get Raw Materials for Production' button will fetch the required raw material Items in the Material Request Plan table. For example, to manufacture 200 plastic canes, you need 100 raw plastic Nos but have only 20 in your Warehouse, then clicking this button will add a row with 80 in the Required Quantity column. Use the following checkboxes to perform certain actions: Include Non Stock Items: To include non-stock items in the material request planning. i.e. Items for which 'Maintain Stock' checkbox is unticked. Refer the Item page for more details. Include Subcontracted Items: To add subcontracted Item's raw materials if include exploded items is disabled. Ignore Existing Projected Quantity: If enabled then the system will create the Material Request even if the user has already ordered or requested the respective items. For example if you need 100 quantity of raw material A and even if you already have 150, enabling this checkbox will add a request for 100 quantity of that raw material. For Warehouse: User can set the Warehouse for which they want to create the material request. When creating Stock Entries during the production process, the system will look for raw material stock in this Warehouse. Download Materials Required:- When this checkbox is ticked, the User will get the Excel sheet with the raw materials that are needed to complete this Production Plan. User can select the Warehouse to check the available quantity in the respective Warehouse. If the User has kept the 'For Warehouse' field as blank then the system will give the Excel sheet with raw materials and Warehouse-wise available quantity of the respective raw materials. Excel sheet will look similar to: 2.4 After Submitting Once the Production Plan is submitted, the User gets an option to make Work Orders for the production items and Material Requests for the raw materials. Users can also set the Status as Closed in the Production Plan. 2.4.1 Closing a Production Plan There could be occurrences where a Production Plan is partially complete and is going to be discontinued. This could happen due to reasons such as: One of the items was independently produced outside the Production Plan. A change in plans occurred and pending items will not be produced. In cases like these, Users can set the Production Plan status to Closed, so that no new Work Orders or Material Requests are created against it. The same can be Re-opened. 2.5 Making work order for the sub-assembly items In the above screenshot, the User creates the Shaving Brush Bristles first and then creates final finished goods. Here, the User wants to make the work order for Shaving Brush Bristles, to do this, the user has to enable the field \"Make Work Order for Sub Assembly Items\" in the Production Plan against the item Shaving Brush. On clicking make Work Order, the system will generate the Work Order for the sub-assembly items and the finished good items: 3.

    "title": "Work Order",
    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Work Order A Work Order is a document given to the manufacturing shop floor by the Production Planner as a signal to manufacture a certain quantity of a certain Item. The Work Order also helps generate the material requirements (Stock Entry) for the Item to be produced from its Bill of Materials. The Work Order can be generated from the Production Plan based on Sales Orders. To access the Work Order list, go to: Home > Manufacturing > Production > Work Order 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Work Order, it is advised that you create the following first: Bill Of Materials Operation Workstation 2. How to Create a Work Order Go to the Work Order list, click on New. Select the Item to be manufactured. The default BOM for that item will be fetched by the system. You can also change the BOM. Enter the quantity to manufacture. Raw material Items will be fetched only when this is set. If the selected BOM has Operations mentioned in it, the system will fetch all Operations from BOM, these values can be changed. Refer section 3.2 to know more. Set the Planned Start Date (an Estimated Date at which you want the Production to begin). Use Multi-Level BOM: This is enabled by default. If you want to plan materials for sub-assemblies of the Item you're manufacturing leave this enabled. If you plan and manufacture the sub-assemblies separately, you can disable this checkbox. To know more, visit this page. Select Warehouses: Source Warehouses: Select this Warehouse in the Item row. The warehouse where you store your raw materials. Each required item can have a separate source warehouse. Group warehouse also can be selected as source warehouse. On submission of the Work Order, the raw materials will be reserved in these warehouses for production usage. Work-in-Progress Warehouse: The warehouse where your Items will be transferred when you begin production. Group Warehouse can also be selected as a Work in Progress warehouse. Target Warehouse: The warehouse where you store finished Items before they are shipped. Scrap Warehouse: If the BOM results in Scrap material, the Scrap Warehouse needs to be selected. Required Items: All the required items (raw materials) will be fetched from BOM and populated in this table. Here you can also change the Source Warehouse for any item. And during the production, you can track transferred raw materials from this table. Note: You can save a Work Order without selecting the Warehouses, but Warehouses are mandatory for submitting a Work Order. A Work Order can also be directly created from a Sales Order. 2.1 Additional Options when Creating a Work Order Sales Order: If you create a Work Order from a Sales Order, it will be fetched here. You can also link an existing Sales Order which has the Item to be manufactured to this Work Order. Project: Link the Work Order to a Project to track progress in cases like engineer to order. Allow Alternative Item: Sometimes when manufacturing a finished good, specific materials may not be available. For example, using plastic beads instead of plastic crystals. The finished good itself could be different. Ticking this checkbox will allow you the select an Alternative Item. To know more, visit this page. Skip Material Transfer to WIP Warehouse: Usually, a Stock Entry is created when the raw materials are transferred to a Work In Progress Warehouse. In this case, the raw material is considered to be consumed hence the Stock Entry is skipped. The next option will be shown if you tick this checkbox. Backflush Raw Materials From Work-in-Progress Warehouse: Ticking this checkbox will automatically create a Stock Entry with the type 'Manufacture'. This means that the raw materials were consumed from the Source Warehouse, used to manufacture finished goods and another Stock Entry was created for your Target Warehouse. 3. Features 3.1 Time The Planned Start Date and Expected Delivery Date can be set here. The default for Planned Start Date is the current date and time at the time of creating the Work Order. 3.2 Required Items table The Source Warehouse can be changed for the raw material items used here. The default Warehouse can be set at the Item level in the Item master or globally in Stock Settings. Required Quantity: This will be calculated automatically based on the Bill Of Materials. Transferred Quantity: Once the Work Order starts and Job Cards are run, items are transferred from the Source Warehouse to Work In Progress Warehouse. This field shows the quantity in the WIP Warehouse. Note that if you tick on 'Skip Material Transfer to WIP Warehouse', this column will not be updated. Consumed Quantity: When the Item from the WIP Warehouse is consumed and the finished product is manufactured, this field will be updated. Allow Alternative Item: If a particular Item (raw material or sub-assembly) is not available, ticking this checkbox will allow you to select an alternative item defined in the Item Alternative list. Skip Material Transfer: If you don't want to transfer the specific raw material to the work in progress warehouse then you need to enable this checkbox. Once uncheck this checkbox for an Item, you can still select it in the BOM and Work Order, but no Stock Entries will be created against it. Once the Work Order is saved the following two fields will also show the availability in the respective Warehouses in the Required Items table: Available Qty at Source Warehouse Available Qty at WIP Warehouse 3.2 Operations table Materials can be transferred against a Work Order or a Job Card. This is usually fetched from the Bill Of Materials, but you can change it in the Work Order also. The following will be fetched from the BOM: In the Operations table: The Workstations where the Operations will be performed In the Items table: The Operations which will be performed on the Items These values can also be changed. Once the Work Order is saved the following fields will be shown: Completed Qty: The number of Items on which this Operation was performed. Status: Whether the Operation is Pending, Work In Progress, or Completed. The status here is updated when the Job Cards are updated. Operation Time: This is fetched from the BOM, but can be changed. Planned Operating Cost: This is calculated based on the Operating Time, Hourly Rate, Quantity being manufactured, etc. The Actual Operation Time, Actual Operating Cost, Actual Start Time, and Actual End Time are updated when Job Cards are updated. 3.3 Operation Cost In this section, the following are shown: Planned Operating Cost: This is fetched as per the BOM and the Operations defined in it. Actual Operating Cost: This is fetched from the Job Cards based on the Operations run on the Items. Additional Operating Cost: Any additional expenses you may have incurred when manufacturing the Item can be added here. Total Operating Cost: This is calculated as Actual Operating Cost + Additional Operating Cost. These values are calculated as per the Job Cards. 3.4 More Information Here the Item Description and Stock UOM is shown for the Item being manufactured. When a Work Order is created from a Material Request, it'll be shown here. 3.5 Transferring Materials for Manufacturing Once you have submitted your Work Order, you need to Transfer the Raw Materials to initiate the Manufacturing Process. This will create a Stock Entry with all the Items required to complete this Work Order to be added to the WIP Warehouse. This will add the sub-assembly Items as is or explode them to show the raw materials depending on whether you ticked 'Use Multi-Level BOM' or not. Click on 'Start'. Once you click on Start, Job Cards will be created for the Operations involved. Mention the quantity of materials to be transferred in this run. You'll be taken to a Stock Entry for 'Material Transfer for Manufacture'. Submit it. Material Transferred for Manufacturing will be updated in the Work Order based on the Stock Entry. 3.6 Material Transfer through Stock Entry Use cases for this option are: If a material transfer is done in bulk and/or is not required to be tracked against a particular Work Order. If the responsibility for Material Transfer and Production Entry lies with two separate Users. If this is the case, you can tick the 'Skip Material Transfer' checkbox, which will allow you to make the Stock Entry of type 'Manufacture' directly by clicking on the ‘Finish’ button. 3.7 Creating Job Cards Progress in the Work Order can be tracked using Job Cards Drafts of Job Cards are created based on when a Work Order is Submitted. To create more Job Cards against a Work Order click on the plus sign next to Job Card on the Work Order dashboard. To know more about Job Cards, visit this page. 3.8 Updating Finished Goods Once you are done with the Work Order you need to update the Finished Goods. This will create a Stock Entry that will deduct all the items and sub-assemblies from the WIP Warehouse and add them to the Finished Goods Warehouse. Click on 'Finish'. Mention the quantity of materials to be transferred. Tip: You can also partially complete a Work Order by updating the Finished Goods stock creating a Stock Entry. 3.9 Capacity Planning in Work Order When a Work Order is submitted, based on the Planned Start Date and the availability of the Workstations, the system schedules all operations for the Work Order (if Work Order has Operations specified). Drafts of Time Logs are also created based on the scheduled operations. On Submitting the Work Order, the system will reserve a slot for each of the Work Order Operations serially after the planned start date based on the Workstation availability. The Workstation availability depends on the Workstation timings, holiday list, and if some other Work Order Operation is scheduled in that slot. You can mention the number of days for the system to try scheduling the operations in the Manufacturing Settings. This is set to 30 Days by default. If the operation requires time exceeding the available slot, the system will ask you to break the operations. Once the scheduling is done the system will create Time Logs and save them. You can Modify them and submit them later. 4.0 Stopping a Work Order When you stop a Work Order its status is changed to Stopped indicating that all production process against that Work Order has stopped. But before stopping the work order user has to make sure that the raw materials which were transferred to the Work In Progress warehouse have been returned or not. In case, if the user has tried to stop the work order without returning the raw materials then the system will throw the error and not allow the user to stop the work order. To stop a Work Order, click on the 'Stop' button. You can also re-open the stopped Work Order. 4. Video 5.

      "3.3 Operation Cost": "In this section, the following are shown: Planned Operating Cost: This is fetched as per the BOM and the Operations defined in it.\nActual Operating Cost: This is fetched from the Job Cards based on the Operations run on the Items.\nAdditional Operating Cost: Any additional expenses you may have incurred when manufacturing the Item can be added here.\nTotal Operating Cost: This is calculated as Actual Operating Cost + Additional Operating Cost. These values are calculated as per the Job Cards.",
      "3.4 More Information": "Here the Item Description and Stock UOM is shown for the Item being manufactured. When a Work Order is created from a Material Request, it'll be shown here.",
      "3.5 Transferring Materials for Manufacturing": "Once you have submitted your Work Order, you need to Transfer the Raw Materials to initiate the Manufacturing Process.\nThis will create a Stock Entry with all the Items required to complete this Work Order to be added to the WIP Warehouse. This will add the sub-assembly Items as is or explode them to show the raw materials depending on whether you ticked 'Use Multi-Level BOM' or not.\nClick on 'Start'. Once you click on Start, Job Cards will be created for the Operations involved.\n\nMention the quantity of materials to be transferred in this run.\n\nYou'll be taken to a Stock Entry for 'Material Transfer for Manufacture'. Submit it.\nMaterial Transferred for Manufacturing will be updated in the Work Order based on the Stock Entry.

Once you click on Start, Job Cards will be created for the Operations involved. Mention the quantity of materials to be transferred in this run. You'll be taken to a Stock Entry for 'Material Transfer for Manufacture'. Submit it. Material Transferred for Manufacturing will be updated in the Work Order based on the Stock Entry.",
      "3.6 Material Transfer through Stock Entry": "Use cases for this option are: If a material transfer is done in bulk and/or is not required to be tracked against a particular Work Order.\nIf the responsibility for Material Transfer and Production Entry lies with two separate Users. If this is the case, you can tick the 'Skip Material Transfer' checkbox, which will allow you to make the Stock Entry of type 'Manufacture' directly by clicking on the ‘Finish’ button.",
      "3.7 Creating Job Cards": "Progress in the Work Order can be tracked using Job Cards\nDrafts of Job Cards are created based on when a Work Order is Submitted.\nTo create more Job Cards against a Work Order click on the plus sign next to Job Card on the Work Order dashboard. To know more about Job Cards, visit this page.",
      "3.8 Updating Finished Goods": "Once you are done with the Work Order you need to update the Finished Goods.\nThis will create a Stock Entry that will deduct all the items and sub-assemblies from the WIP Warehouse and add them to the Finished Goods Warehouse.\nClick on 'Finish'.\n\nMention the quantity of materials to be transferred. Click on 'Finish'. Mention the quantity of materials to be transferred. Tip: You can also partially complete a Work Order by updating the Finished Goods stock creating a Stock Entry.",
      "3.9 Capacity Planning in Work Order": "When a Work Order is submitted, based on the Planned Start Date and the availability of the Workstations, the system schedules all operations for the Work Order (if Work Order has Operations specified).\nDrafts of Time Logs are also created based on the scheduled operations. On Submitting the Work Order, the system will reserve a slot for each of the Work Order Operations serially after the planned start date based on the Workstation availability. The Workstation availability depends on the Workstation timings, holiday list, and if some other Work Order Operation is scheduled in that slot. You can mention the number of days for the system to try scheduling the operations in the Manufacturing Settings. This is set to 30 Days by default. If the operation requires time exceeding the available slot, the system will ask you to break the operations. Once the scheduling is done the system will create Time Logs and save them. You can Modify them and submit them later.",
      "4.0 Stopping a Work Order": "When you stop a Work Order its status is changed to Stopped indicating that all production process against that Work Order has stopped. But before stopping the work order user has to make sure that the raw materials which were transferred to the Work In Progress warehouse have been returned or not. In case, if the user has tried to stop the work order without returning the raw materials then the system will throw the error and not allow the user to stop the work order. To stop a Work Order, click on the 'Stop' button. You can also re-open the stopped Work Order.",

Review changes Manufacturing Settings Manufacturing settings in OMEX configure production workflows, manage bill of materials (BOM), track work orders, and oversee inventory to streamline operations and ensure efficient production management. Home > Manufacturing > Settings > Manufacturing Settings Raw Materials Consumption 1. Allow Continuous Material Consumption If enabled, materials can be consumed without immediately manufacturing finished goods in a single Work Order. This is useful if one or more time consuming products are being manufactured. For example a single product takes a month to manufacture and the raw materials are consumed daily. In a regular scenario, this won't be feasible with stock entries. Enabling this option will allow you to create stock entries for Material Consumption without having to create an entry to backflush. End result is that you can see the stock being consumed in the Warehouses and can update the final manufacture entry for finished goods at a later stage. 2. Backflush raw materials based on The method selected here will be chosen for backflushing raw materials : 1. Material Transferred for Manufacture 2. BOM 3. Validate Components and Quantities Per BOM Note: This feature will be available from the version V15 If \"Backflush Raw Materials Based On\" as BOM, then users can validate component quantity according to BOM. To do that they have to enable \"Validate Components Quantities Per BOM\" checkbox in the \"Manufacturing Settings\". If user has changed the quantity in the \"Material Transfer for Manufacture\" or \"Manufacture\" stock entry, then system will throw the below error If user has removed the item in the \"Material Transfer for Manufacture\" or \"Manufacture\" stock entry, then system will throw the below error 4. Get Raw Materials Cost from Consumption Entry If the 'Allow Continuous Material Consumption' is enabled then user can see the option 'Get Raw Materials Cost from Consumption Entry'. The 'Get Raw Materials Cost from Consumption Entry', determines whether the cost of raw materials used in production should be automatically derived from the consumption entries recorded during the manufacturing process. When enabled, OMEX calculates the cost based on the actual materials consumed, ensuring accurate cost tracking and financial reporting. Capacity Planning Capacity planning is the process in which an organisation decides whether or not to accept the new orders based on the resources and existing work orders. 1. Disable Capacity Planning If checked, capacity planning won't be done. Enabling it will help to decide whether or not to accept the new orders based on the resources and existing work orders. 2. Allow Overtime If enabled it'll allow creating work orders, job cards etc. outside workstation working hours. 3. Allow Production on Holidays If enabled, it'll allow production activities even on those days that are marked as holidays as per the Holiday List of the organisation. 4. Capacity Planning For (Days) The number of days specified here means the number of days in advance when the capacity planning activities will be initiated for production. 5. Time Between Operations (Mins) This specifies the time span that should be kept between two operations in minutes. Default Warehouses for Production 1. Default Work In Progress Warehouse This Warehouse will be auto-updated in the 'Work In Progress' Warehouse field of Work Orders. 2. Default Finished Goods Warehouse This Warehouse will be auto-updated in the 'Target Warehouse' field of Work Order. 3. Default Scrap Warehouse This Warehouse will be auto-updated in the 'Scrap Warehouse' field of Work Order. Over Production for Sales and Work Order 1. Overproduction Percentage For Sales Order It allows you to specify a percentage by which production can exceed the sales order quantity. 2. Overproduction Percentage For Work Order It defines the allowable percentage by which the actual production quantity can exceed the planned quantity specified in a work order. Job Card 1. Add Corrective Operation Cost in Finished Good Valuation If enabled then the cost for a corrective operation type will also be included while calculating finished goods valuation 2. Allow Excess Material Transfer If enabled, the Material Transfer button will be visible and will allow you to transfer raw materials even if after the raw material requirement is fulfilled against a Job Card. This is particularly useful in cases where the transferred raw materials are damaged and additional raw materials need to be transferred to produce the same amount of finished goods as intended. Other Settings 1. Update BOM Cost Automatically If ticked, the BOM cost will be automatically updated based on Valuation Rate / Price List Rate / last purchase rate of raw materials. 2. Set Operating Cost / Scrape Items From Sub-assemblies In the case of 'Use Multi-Level BOM' in a work order, if the user wishes to add sub-assembly costs to Finished Goods items without using a job card as well the scrap items, then this option needs to be enable. 3.

To do that they have to enable \"Validate Components Quantities Per BOM\" checkbox in the \"Manufacturing Settings\".\nIf user has changed the quantity in the \"Material Transfer for Manufacture\" or \"Manufacture\" stock entry, then system will throw the below error\n \nIf user has removed the item in the \"Material Transfer for Manufacture\" or \"Manufacture\" stock entry, then system will throw the below error\n\n4. Get Raw Materials Cost from Consumption Entry\nIt determines whether the cost of raw materials used in production should be automatically derived from the consumption entries recorded during the manufacturing process. When enabled, OMEX calculates the cost based on the actual materials consumed, ensuring accurate cost tracking and financial reporting.\nCapacity Planning\nCapacity planning is the process in which an organisation decides whether or not to accept the new orders based on the resources and existing work orders.\n \n1. Disable Capacity Planning\nIf checked, capacity planning won't be done. Enabling it will help to decide whether or not to accept the new orders based on the resources and existing work orders.\n2. Allow Overtime\nIf enabled it'll allow creating work orders, job cards etc. outside workstation working hours.\n3. Allow Production on Holidays\nIf enabled, it'll allow production activities even on those days that are marked as holidays as per the Holiday List of the organisation.\n4. Capacity Planning For (Days)\nThe number of days specified here means the number of days in advance when the capacity planning activities will be initiated for production.\n5. Time Between Operations (Mins)\nThis specifies the time span that should be kept between two operations in minutes.\nDefault Warehouses for Production\n \n1. Default Work In Progress Warehouse\nThis Warehouse will be auto-updated in the 'Work In Progress' Warehouse field of Work Orders.\n2. Default Finished Goods Warehouse\nThis Warehouse will be auto-updated in the 'Target Warehouse' field of Work Order.\n3. Default Scrap Warehouse\nThis Warehouse will be auto-updated in the 'Scrap Warehouse' field of Work Order.\nOver Production for Sales and Work Order\n \n1. Overproduction Percentage For Sales Order\nIt allows you to specify a percentage by which production can exceed the sales order quantity.\n2. Overproduction Percentage For Work Order\nIt defines the allowable percentage by which the actual production quantity can exceed the planned quantity specified in a work order.\nJob Card\n \n1. Add Corrective Operation Cost in Finished Good Valuation\nIf enabled then the cost for a corrective operation type will also be included while calculating finished goods valuation\n2. Allow Excess Material Transfer\nIf enabled, the Material Transfer button will be visible and will allow you to transfer raw materials even if after the raw material requirement is fulfilled against a Job Card.\nThis is particularly useful in cases where the transferred raw materials are damaged and additional raw materials need to be transferred to produce the same amount of finished goods as intended.\nOther Settings\n \n1. Update BOM Cost Automatically\nIf ticked, the BOM cost will be automatically updated based on Valuation Rate / Price List Rate / last purchase rate of raw materials.\n2. Set Operating Cost / Scrape Items From Sub-assemblies\nIn the case of 'Use Multi-Level BOM' in a work order, if the user wishes to add sub-assembly costs to Finished Goods items without using a job card as well the scrap items, then this option needs to be enable.\n3. Make Serial No/Batch from Work Order\nIf checked, system will automatically create the serial numbers / batches for finished goods on submission of Work Order Manufacturing settings in OMEX configure production workflows, manage bill of materials (BOM), track work orders, and oversee inventory to streamline operations and ensure efficient production management.

      "1. Allow Continuous Material Consumption": "If enabled, materials can be consumed without immediately manufacturing finished goods in a single Work Order. This is useful if one or more time consuming products are being manufactured. For example a single product takes a month to manufacture and the raw materials are consumed daily. In a regular scenario, this won't be feasible with stock entries. Enabling this option will allow you to create stock entries for Material Consumption without having to create an entry to backflush. End result is that you can see the stock being consumed in the Warehouses and can update the final manufacture entry for finished goods at a later stage.",

Review changes Manufacturing Reports There are various reports in the Manufacturing module that help you track Work Order progress, production analytics, BOM reports, etc. In all of these reports, you can set a chart to show a visual representation. To do this, click on the Set Chart button. These reports can be accessed from: Home > Manufacturing > Reports Open Work Orders Shows the open Work Orders which have not started production yet. Work in Progress Report This report shows any work orders that have started and are in progress. The status of these Work Orders is 'In Process'. Issued Items Against Work Order Items that are issued to a Work Order and are transferred to the Work in Progress Warehouse are shown here. Completed Work Orders Work Orders which are completed with all the quantities in it manufactured are shown in this report. Production Analytics This report shows the overall analytics of all Work Orders. BOM Search In this report, you can search for specific BOMs based on the raw materials items used in them, then open it. Useful if you have a lot of BOMs. BOM Stock Report On selecting a BOM in this report, the raw material quantity in Warehouses will be shown. As you can see, the items which have insufficient quantity are shown in red and ones with enough quantity to manufacture the BOM Item are shown in green.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Job Card A Job Card stores actual production information about a particular Operation performed on a particular Workstation. A Job Card is created from the Work Order and given to each of the Workstations in the manufacturing floor to start the production of an item with a certain quantity in each of the operations defined in the Work Order. Job Card allows each Operation's workstation to issue a “Material Request” and “Stock Transfer to Manufacture” for raw material required against a “Job Card”. Job Card completion will change the production status in Work Order, we can track the completion of production progress for each of the Operations defined in the Work Order. To access the Job Card list, go to: Home > Manufacturing > Production > Job Card 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Job Card, it is advised that you create the following first: Bill Of Materials Operation Workstation Work Order 2. How to Create a Job Card Job Card for Operations is automatically created when a Work Order is submitted. This is what a Job Card looks like: To use a Job Card follow these steps: Click on the Start Job button, then on Complete Job when you're done. Alternatively, you can also fill the From Time and To Time in the Time Logs table. Select the Employee to whom the Job Card was assigned. Enter the Completed Quantity. This is the number of Items on which the Operation was performed for the selected time interval. Add more rows in the Time Logs table and record time using the Start/Completed buttons. Click on Submit. In a Work Order, the Operations and Workstations are fetched from the BOM of an Item. For ease of use, you should ensure that the Routing is configured in the BOM. Each Job Card created will have Workstation & Operations assigned. The raw material required from each Source Warehouse will be calculated based on quantity required for production. On submitting a Work Order, Job Cards will be auto-created based on the values in the Operations table. 2.1 Select Work Order with Item to Manufacture You can select 'Transfer Material Against' as 'Job Card' on the Bill of Materials to transfer raw materials for Production against Job Cards. In the Work Order, you can select the option: 2.3 Using a Job Card Employee assignment and timing detail will also be defined in Job Card. The time taken to do a job can be recorded. If multiple employees are working on the same Operation, add new job cards by clicking on the 'Create Job' Card button. 2.4 Material Request against Job Card A Material Request will be raised from the Job Card as a basis/order to prepare raw material required for the manufacturing process. The Material Request raised will have its reference to the original Job Card number. Track the Manufacturing Progress in The Work Order by The Completion of Each Operations defined in Work Order. Job Card completion allows you to track the manufacturing progress inside the Work Order by looking at the completion of each Operation related to the Work Order. 2.5 Scrap Items While completing the operations, there might be chances that some scrap materials will be produced. This scrap materials are required to be added in the inventory. For that user needs to put the details of the scrap items in the job card. User can also set the defective materials / broken materials in the scrap items table. 3. Features 3.1 Tracking Quality Inspection Introduced in Version 13 For production orders, the quality of in-process (semi-finished) goods also needs to be tracked. It is defined by the process (operation) performed on it which is in turn defined in the Job Card. In-process tests are different than incoming and outgoing material tests. Monitoring quality during manufacturing helps to make sure that the finished product produced is of the desired quality. You can create a Quality Inspection for the Production Item against the Job Card. For more details, refer the Quality Inspection page.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Managing Multi-level BOM Consider a scenario where your manufacturing process involves producing sub-assembly items before the final product. In this case, how should you manage the BOM? First of all, you need to have BOMs for the sub-assemblies, then these BOMs should be linked to the BOM of the final finished product. In the following screenshot, you can see that the BOM for Brush Bristles (subassembly) is linked to the BOM of the Shaving Brush (final product). This is seen in the Materials table in the Bill of Materials master. The 'Materials' table will only show the sub-assemblies while the 'Materials Required (Exploded)' table will show all the raw materials required to manufacture the final product. BOM materials table where sub-assembly is shown: In the exploded view only the raw materials are shown: To use multi-level BOM in a Work Order, enable the 'Use Multi-Level BOM' checkbox. This is enabled by default. If you want to plan materials for sub-assemblies of the Item you're manufacturing leave this enabled. If you plan and manufacture the sub-assemblies separately disable this checkbox. Let's consider another example to understand this better where a computer is being assembled. The hard disk and DVD drive are also being manufactured and are the sub-assemblies. The multi-level or nested BOM will look like this: Personal Computer (FG Item) Mother Board SMTP Accessories and wires Hard Disk (sub-assembly) Item A Item B Item C DVD Drive (sub-assembly) Item X Item Y Item Z Caution Exercise caution when updating the BOM of a sub-assembly. The part which includes the sub assembly with an updated BOM will need to be updated to reference the updated BOM for that part. The practical outcome of this is that changing a screw on a low level assembly will lead to a ripple of updated Bills of Material up through the BOM structure. Using the example of the personal computer above. Personal Computer (PC-001 with BOM-PC-001) uses Hard Disk (HDD-001 with BOM-HDD-001). BOM-HDD-001 includes the three items shown (Item A, B and C). If we need to exchange Item C for a new item (Item D) then we must update create BOM-HDD-002 (with Items A, B and D). The Hard Disk (HDD-001) is then updated to reference the new BOM-HDD-002. But, BOM-PC-001 is still referencing HDD-001 with BOM-HDD-001. The change from Item C to Item D will not be updated in the Exploded BOM for PC-001. BOM-PC-002 must be created referencing HDD-001 with BOM-HDD-002 to make this update.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Multi-level BOM Creator The BOM Creator enables users to create multi-level BOMs using a single screen. Why use the BOM Creator? Users often question why a separate BOM Creator is needed to create BOMs. The answer lies in eliminating the need for unnecessary back and forth. With the standard BOM screen, users are required to create all sub-assembly BOMs first and then create the BOM for the final product. This process often involves a lot of back and forth. Additionally, sometimes it's challenging to visualize the complete hierarchy using the standard BOM. To address all of these problems, we have introduced the BOM Creator. Within the BOM Creator, users can construct a multi-level BOM using the tree component. Here's how it works: The user selects the Final Product and saves the record. In the form, users will find an option to add Raw Materials and Sub-assembly items related to the Final Product. If a user wants to convert Raw Materials into Sub-assembly items, they need to click on the item first and then click the \"Convert to Sub-Assembly\" button. Users can edit the Quantity as needed. Final Step One the BOM structure has made using the tree component, user has to submit the BOM Creator. On Submission of the BOM Creator, system will generate the BOMs using the background job.

Review changes BOM Comparison Tool Using the BOM Comparison Tool, you can compare two BOMs and see what changed between their iterations. A BOM (Bill of Materials) of an Item undergoes several changes over time. When you need to change something in your BOM, you have to Cancel the BOM, Amend it, make the change and create a new version of the BOM. Now you have two different BOMs and change history is lost. The BOM Comparison Tool lets you compare two different BOMs and will show you what changed between them. To use the BOM Comparison Tool, go to: Home > Manufacturing > Tools > BOM Comparison Tool 1. How to use the BOM Comparison Tool Select the old BOM against which you want to compare in BOM 1 field. Select the new BOM of which you want to see the changes in BOM 2 field. The changes will be shown as soon as you select both the values.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes BOM Costing in different Currency User can change the Currency in the BOM before submitting. The system calculates the costing based on the Price List currency. You can check the manufacturing cost in a particular Currency by changing the Currency in the BOM. Consider that you import plastic as a raw material from Japan and the Sales Invoices are in the Yen currency. Your company Currency is INR but you want the BOM costing to be done in Yen. On setting 'Rate Of Materials Based On' to 'Price List' the raw materials used in the BOM will also have rates set in Yen. These rates are fetched from the Price List you create for Japan. In this case, it is a buying Price List called 'Import Japan'. If you select 'Rate Of Materials Based On' to 'Valuation Rate' or 'Last Purchase Rate', the prices will be fetched from the Item master or the Sales Invoice respectively. In case of Item master, you'll need to enter the Valuation Rate in your Currency. In the BOM, Valuation Rate will be converted to the Currency set in the BOM.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes BOM Update Tool From the BOM Update Tool, you can replace a sub-assembly BOM and update costs of all parent BOMs. Using this utility, you can replace an existing BOM of a sub-assembly item which is linked to a parent BOM. The system will update the new BOM in all the parent BOMs where it was used. You need to create a new BOM first. To use the BOM Update Tool, go to: Home > Manufacturing > Tools > BOM Update Tool 1. How to use the BOM Update Tool Let's consider a scenario to understand this better. Suppose a company manufactures computers, Bill of Materials for the computer will look like this: Monitor Key Board Mouse CPU Out of all the items above, CPU is assembled separately. Hence separate BOM will be created for the CPU. Following are the items from the BOM of CPU. 250 GB Hard Disk MotherBoard Processor SMTP DVD player If more items need to be added, or existing items to be edited in the CPU BOM, then create new BOM for it. _950 GB Hard Disk_ MotherBoard Processor SMTP DVD player Select Current BOM and New BOM of the sub-assembly Item: To update the new BOM in all the parent BOMs, where CPU is selected as sub-assembly, you can use the Replace button. On clicking Replace button, old BOM of CPU will be replaced with the new BOM in the BOM of finished Item (Computer). Will BOM Replace Tool work for replacing the exploded Items in the parent BOM? No, exploded Items which do not have any BOMs of their own cannot be replaced in the parent BOM. For example, consider if the Item Monitor does not have a sub-assembly and it cannot be updated using this tool. For updating exploded Items you should Cancel and Amend current BOM, or create a new BOM for the finished item. Update BOM Cost Using the button Update latest price in all BOMs, you can update the cost of all Bill of Materials, based on the latest purchase price/price list rate/valuation rate of raw materials. This is useful if your updated BOM has materials with different Rates. On clicking this button, the system will create a background process to update all the BOM's cost. It is processed via background jobs because this process can take a few minutes (depending on the number of BOMs) to update all the BOMs. This functionality can also be executed automatically daily. For that, you need to enable \"Update BOM Cost Automatically\" from Manufacturing Settings.

Review changes Stock Reservation for Work Order Note: This feature will be available in the OMEX version 16 Stock reservation for a work order is essential as it ensures that materials are available, enabling the manufacturing process to begin and produce finished goods. It also helps to improve inventory management and ensures timely fulfillment of customer orders. How it Works in OMEX The user must enable the checkbox \"Enable Stock Reservation\" in the stock settings to use this feature. After enabling it, the checkbox \"Reserve Stock\" will appear in the work order. If the \"Reserve Stock\" checkbox is selected, the system will automatically create a stock reservation entry against the source warehouse for the available stock upon submission of the work order. The reserved stock can only be used for the respective work order and cannot be used in any other transactions. Unreserve Stock If the reserved stock needs to be assigned to another work order, unreserve it from the current work order and assign it to the work order that does not have stock reserved. Reservation for WIP Once the user transfers the materials from the source warehouse to the WIP warehouse using a stock entry with the type \"Material Transfer for Manufacture\", the system unreserves the stock from the source warehouse and reserves it against the WIP warehouse. Finished Goods Reservation If the sales order is linked to the work order, the system reserves the finished goods against the respective sales order upon completion of the work order.

Review changes Track Semi-Finished Goods Note: This feature will be available in the OMEX version 16 Semi-finished goods are materials that result from the completion of one operation and are used as raw materials to make final products or other semi-finished goods. In OMEX, if you want to track semi-finished goods, you need to create an item for each semi-finished good and also have an active Bill of Materials for each one. So we thought, why can't we have a provision to define the finished/semi-finished goods against the operation as well as raw materials? With this, once we complete the operation, the semi-finished goods will be produced and the raw materials will be consumed. Similarly, after the completion of the last operation, the finished goods will be produced and all semi-finished goods will be consumed. The user has to create a Bill of Materials for each finished/semi-finished good and assign it to operations of the final Bill of Materials, or they can manually select the raw materials required to produce the finished/semi-finished goods. As this sounds like a lengthy process but using the BOM Creator, users can create the Bill of Materials for the final product as well as for semi-finished goods with operations. See below video to know how to make multi-level Bill of Materials with operations BOM (with Operations) If you want to track \"Semi Finished Goods\", you need to enable \"Track Operations\" and \"Track Semi Finished Goods\" while making the BOM. While creating a BOM, the user will have the option to define the operation, operation time, workstation, and workstation type. The user will also have the option to set default warehouses, such as the source warehouse, work in progress warehouse, and finished goods warehouse. If the user has set 'skip material transfer' they can consume materials from the source warehouse or work-in-progress warehouse. If users perform specific operations through subcontracting, they will have options to define subcontracted operations. Users will also have the option to create a subcontracted purchase order against the subcontracted job cards. Work Order In the work order, users can see the finished/semi-finished good as well raw materials against each operations. On submission of the work order system will create the job cards automatically and users have to complete the job cards manually. User can complete the job cards using job card view or from workstation dashboard. Below are different ways to complete the job cards If the 'Skip Material Transfer to WIP' checkbox is enabled and the 'Backflush Materials From WIP Warehouse' checkbox is enabled, then users must consume raw materials from the 'WIP Warehouse'. Users need to click the 'Start Job' button to begin the job and the 'Complete Job' button to stop the job. After that, users must submit the job card to create a stock entry to consume materials from the 'WIP Warehouse' and add finished/semi-finished goods to the 'Target Warehouse'. If the 'Skip Material Transfer to WIP' checkbox is enabled and the 'Backflush Materials From WIP Warehouse' checkbox is disabled, then users must consume raw materials from the 'Source Warehouse'. Users need to click the 'Start Job' button to begin the job and the 'Complete Job' button to stop the job. After that, users must submit the job card to create a stock entry to consume materials from the 'Source Warehouse' and add finished/semi-finished goods to the 'Target Warehouse'. If the 'Skip Material Transfer to WIP' is disabled, then users must have to transfer raw materials from the 'Source Warehouse' to 'Wip Warehouse'. After that, users need to click the 'Start Job' button to begin the job and the 'Complete Job' button to stop the job. After that, users must submit the job card to create a stock entry to consume materials from the 'WIP Warehouse' and add finished/semi-finished goods to the 'Target Warehouse'. Workstation Dashboard Using the workstation dashboard, users can start, pause, resume, and complete job cards. Also, users can transfer raw materials from the source warehouse to the WIP warehouse against the job cards from the workstation dashboard. If \"Skip Material Transfer\" has enabled then no need to transfer raw materials. Also users don't get the subcontracted operations in the workstation dashboard. Transfer Materials For the 'Brake Making' operation, the user has not enabled 'Skip Material Transfer', so they must transfer raw materials from the 'Stores' to the 'Work In Progress' warehouse. For the 'Chain Making' operation, the user has enabled 'Skip Material Transfer,' so they do not need to transfer raw materials.

Also users don't get the subcontracted operations in the workstation dashboard.\nTransfer Materials\nFor the 'Brake Making' operation, the user has not enabled 'Skip Material Transfer', so they must transfer raw materials from the 'Stores' to the 'Work In Progress' warehouse. For the 'Chain Making' operation, the user has enabled 'Skip Material Transfer,' so they do not need to transfer raw materials.\n \nStart Job\nTo start the job card, click on the 'Start' button from the menu. On start system auto fetch the employee of the logged in user and set it in the modal.\nstart-job\nPause Job\nTo pause the job card, click on the 'Pause' button from the menu.\npause-job\nResume Job\nTo resume the job card, click on the 'Resume' button from the menu.\nresume-job\nComplete Job with Auto Stock Entry\nOn click of 'Complete' button, system asks you to enter the quantity and system creates the auto stock entry with type as 'Manufacture'. This stock entry, consume the raw materials and add finished/semi-finished goods.\ncomplete-job\nStart and Complete Jobs Using QR code\nIf you have QR codes for the job cards, you can use them to start and complete the job cards by scanning the QR codes in the 'Start Job'/'Complete Job' QR code fields. Semi-finished goods are materials that result from the completion of one operation and are used as raw materials to make final products or other semi-finished goods. In OMEX, if you want to track semi-finished goods, you need to create an item for each semi-finished good and also have an active Bill of Materials for each one. So we thought, why can't we have a provision to define the finished/semi-finished goods against the operation as well as raw materials? With this, once we complete the operation, the semi-finished goods will be produced and the raw materials will be consumed. Similarly, after the completion of the last operation, the finished goods will be produced and all semi-finished goods will be consumed. The user has to create a Bill of Materials for each finished/semi-finished good and assign it to operations of the final Bill of Materials, or they can manually select the raw materials required to produce the finished/semi-finished goods. As this sounds like a lengthy process but using the BOM Creator, users can create the Bill of Materials for the final product as well as for semi-finished goods with operations. See below video to know how to make multi-level Bill of Materials with operations",
      "BOM (with Operations)": "If you want to track \"Semi Finished Goods\", you need to enable \"Track Operations\" and \"Track Semi Finished Goods\" while making the BOM.\nWhile creating a BOM, the user will have the option to define the operation, operation time, workstation, and workstation type.\nThe user will also have the option to set default warehouses, such as the source warehouse, work in progress warehouse, and finished goods warehouse.\nIf the user has set 'skip material transfer' they can consume materials from the source warehouse or work-in-progress warehouse.\nIf users perform specific operations through subcontracting, they will have options to define subcontracted operations. Users will also have the option to create a subcontracted purchase order against the subcontracted job cards.",
      "Work Order": "In the work order, users can see the finished/semi-finished good as well raw materials against each operations. On submission of the work order system will create the job cards automatically and users have to complete the job cards manually. User can complete the job cards using job card view or from workstation dashboard. Below are different ways to complete the job cards If the 'Skip Material Transfer to WIP' checkbox is enabled and the 'Backflush Materials From WIP Warehouse' checkbox is enabled, then users must consume raw materials from the 'WIP Warehouse'. Users need to click the 'Start Job' button to begin the job and the 'Complete Job' button to stop the job. After that, users must submit the job card to create a stock entry to consume materials from the 'WIP Warehouse' and add finished/semi-finished goods to the 'Target Warehouse'.\nIf the 'Skip Material Transfer to WIP' checkbox is enabled and the 'Backflush Materials From WIP Warehouse' checkbox is disabled, then users must consume raw materials from the 'Source Warehouse'. Users need to click the 'Start Job' button to begin the job and the 'Complete Job' button to stop the job. After that, users must submit the job card to create a stock entry to consume materials from the 'Source Warehouse' and add finished/semi-finished goods to the 'Target Warehouse'.\nIf the 'Skip Material Transfer to WIP' is disabled, then users must have to transfer raw materials from the 'Source Warehouse' to 'Wip Warehouse'. After that, users need to click the 'Start Job' button to begin the job and the 'Complete Job' button to stop the job. After that, users must submit the job card to create a stock entry to consume materials from the 'WIP Warehouse' and add finished/semi-finished goods to the 'Target Warehouse'.",
      "Workstation Dashboard": "Using the workstation dashboard, users can start, pause, resume, and complete job cards. Also, users can transfer raw materials from the source warehouse to the WIP warehouse against the job cards from the workstation dashboard. If \"Skip Material Transfer\" has enabled then no need to transfer raw materials. Also users don't get the subcontracted operations in the workstation dashboard.",

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Stock Reservation for Production Plan Note: This feature will be available in the OMEX version 16 Stock reservation in a production plan is important because it ensures that the required raw materials and sub-assemblies are available to start the manufacturing process. It also ensures that the purchased raw materials against the production plan are used exclusively for the respective production plan. How it Works in OMEX The user activity diagram for the production plan reservation is shown below. The user must enable the checkbox \"Enable Stock Reservation\" in the stock settings to use this feature. After enabling it, the checkbox \"Reserve Stock\" will appear in the Production Plan. If the 'Reserve Stock' checkbox is selected, the system will automatically create a stock reservation entry for the sub-assembly items and raw materials if the stock exists. If stock does not exist for the sub-assemblies or raw materials, the user must create work orders for the sub-assemblies and raise material requests (purchase) for the raw materials. Once the raw materials are purchased through these material requests, they will be automatically reserved against the respective production plan. The materials reserved against the production plan will then be used for the work orders linked to that specific production plan.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Subcontracting in OMEX Subcontracting is a type of job contract that seeks to outsource certain types of work to other companies. It allows work on more than one phase of the project to be done at once, often leading to quicker completion. It is practiced by various industries. For example, manufacturers who make a number of products from complex components subcontract certain components and package them at their facilities. If your business involves outsourcing certain processes to a third party Supplier where you supply the raw materials and the third party does the labor/production, you can track this by using the subcontracting feature of OMEX. How to manage subcontracting in OMEX? For demonstrating the outsourcing, we are considering below scenario: A manufacturer of flowers produces raw, uncolored flowers. These flowers are packed in cartons (1 Carton = 1000 flowers) and sent for coloring to external vendor. In Item Master of subcontracted item, ensure that you have enabled the option, \"Supply Raw Materials for Purchase\". In our example, the Item is \"RM-111-Colored Flower\" Create a BOM (Bill of Material) for the subcontracted Item and include the raw materials that you send to the subcontractor so as to get the finished/semi-finished product. There will be no operations in this BOM since the activities are not done at manufacturer's end. In our example, the BOM of RM-111-Colored-Flower is as below: Now, you need to create the Purchase Order for procuring this Item from the external party/vendor. Ensure that you select \"Yes\" for the field, \"Supply Raw Materials\" and then select the warehouse from which the raw materials will be transferred to the vendor. Note that this can also be a virtual warehouse just to stand as a placeholder for making the Stock Entry when transferring materials to the vendor. Below is the Purchase Order as per our example: Note: The rate of the Item entered here will be your Service Cost rate. There is also another child table that shows the status of the raw materials to be transferred against this Purchase Order. In that table, you need to select the \"Reserve Warehouse\" from which the raw materials will be transferred to the virtual vendor warehouse that we selected in previous step. This table also tells you how many items have been supplied already, in our case, it is zero since we are yet to submit the order and supply the raw materials. After submission of the Purchase Order, there will be a button, \"Transfer\" for creating the Stock Entry to transfer raw materials to the external vendor: Once the Stock Entry is submitted, the child table in the Purchase Order is also updated to reflect the transferred quantity under \"Supplied Qty\" As in when you receive the semi-finished/finished goods from the vendor, you can create Purchase Receipt against this Purchase Order: The next steps for invoicing follow as per regular Buying Cycle. Purchase Order -> Purchase Receipt -> Purchase Invoice. Purchase Invoice created for this transaction: (Print Format Preview) To learn more about Buying module, please check out our documentation here.

Review changes Opening and Closing The Opening Invoice Creator, Chart of Accounts Importer, and Period Closing Voucher are vital features within OMEX's accounting module. The Opening Invoice Creator facilitates the creation of invoices at the beginning of an accounting period, streamlining the process of recording opening balances for receivables or payables. The Chart of Accounts Importer is a powerful tool that enables users to import a structured list of accounts into OMEX, saving time and reducing errors associated with manual data entry. This feature is particularly useful during system setup or when updating account structures, ensuring that the Chart of Accounts is correctly configured to reflect an organisation's financial structure. The Period Closing Voucher automates the closing activities at the end of an accounting period. It consolidates adjustments, accruals, and other closing entries, providing a systematic way to finalise financial transactions for the period.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Users And Permissions In OMEX, you can create multiple users and assign them different roles. A role is a set of permissions assigned to a user so that they can access the documents they need to. For example, a sales employee will need access to sales transactions but will not have access to approve leaves. Some users can only access the public-facing part of OMEX (i.e. a portal view). Such users are called \"Website Users\". \"System Users\" will have access to modules and can access documents as per the roles set. OMEX implements permission control at the User and Role level. Each user in the system can be assigned multiple roles and permissions. The most important role is \"System Manager\". Any user having this role can add other users and set roles for all users.

Review changes Taxes The tax section in OMEX's accounting module is an important component for managing taxes effectively within the system. It provides a comprehensive set of tools to handle various tax-related tasks, including defining tax rates, creating tax rules, and generating tax reports.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Accounting Reports Some of the major accounting reports are: 1. Company and Accounts General Ledger Go to: Accounts > Company and Accounts > General Ledger. The General Ledger is a detailed report for all transactions posted to each account and for every transaction there is a Credit and Debit account so it lists them all up. The report is based on the table GL Entry and can be filtered by many pre-defined filters like Account, Cost Centers, Party, Project and Period etc. This helps you to get a full update for all entries posted in a period against any account. The result can be grouped by Account, Voucher/Transaction and Party with opening and closing balances for each group. In case of multi-currency accounting, there is also an option to check the amounts in any other currency than company's base currency. 2. Accounting Statements 2.1 Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable (AR / AP) Go to: Accounts > Accounting Statements > Accounts Receivable. These reports help you to track the outstanding amount of Customers and Suppliers. It also provides ageing analysis i.e. a break-up of outstanding amount based on the period for which the amount is outstanding. 2.1.1 Accounts Receivables based on Payment terms You can also see Accounts Receivables based on Payment Terms. Accounts Receivable report based on payment terms can be seen by clicking the checkbox 'Based On Payment Terms' as shown in the following screenshot.

A Trial Balance is an accounting report which lists account balances for all your Accounts (“Ledger” and “Group”) for any given reporting period. A company prepares a trial balance periodically, usually at the end of every reporting period. The general purpose of producing a trial balance is to ensure the entries in a company's bookkeeping system are mathematically correct. The totals of Debit and Credit columns must be same for any given period, to ensure the entries are correct. In OMEX, the report shows following columns: Opening (Dr): Opening debit balance as on From Date Opening (Cr): Opening credit balance as on From Date Debit: Total Debited amount against the account between the selected period Credit: Total Credited amount against the account between the selected period Closing (Dr): Closing debit balance as on To Date Closing (Cr): Closing credit balance as on To Date There are some other options as well to include or exclude Period Closing Entries, show / hide accounts with zero balance and to show unclosed previous fiscal year's P&L (Income & Expenses) balances. All the figures in the report are shown in company's base currency. 2.3 Balance Sheet Go to: Accounts > Accounting Statements > Balance Sheet. A Balance Sheet is the financial statement of a company which states assets, liabilities and equity at a particular point in time. The Balance Sheet in OMEX gives you more flexibility to analyse your financial position. You can run the report across multiple year to compare values. You can check values for a specific Finance Book or Cost Center. You can also choose any other currency to display the balances. 2.4 Cash Flow Statement Go to: Accounts > Accounting Statements > Cash Flow. A Cash Flow is a financial statement which shows the incoming and outgoing of cash or cash-equivalents for a company. It is used to analyse the liquidity position of the company. 2.5 Profit and Loss Statement Go to: Accounts > Accounting Statements > Profit and Loss Statement. A Profit and Loss Statement is a financial statement which summarizes all the revenues and expenses in a given period. The report is also known as P&L Statement. In OMEX, you can run the report across multiple year / period to compare the values. You can also check values for a specific Finance Book, Project or Cost Center. You can also choose any other currency to display the balances. If you are running the report to see quarterly / monthly balances, you can choose whether you want to show accumulated balances or only for each period. 2.6 Consolidated Financial Statements Go to: Accounts > Accounting Statements > Consolidated Financial Statement. The report shows a consolidated view of Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss Statement and Cash Flow for a group company, by merging financial statements of all the subsidary companies. It shows balances for all individual company and as well as accumulated balances for a group company. 2.7 Financial Ratios Report Introduction A financial ratio is a measurement tool used to evaluate a company's financial condition or performance relative to other businesses. This tool is commonly used by investors to study and obtain insight about a company's financial history or the overall industry. The process of computing a financial ratio involves extracting numbers from the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Rather than just being a calculation, a financial ratio offers an understanding of a company's economic status in areas such as profitability, liquidity, leverage, and market valuation. A ratio can act as a signal, alert, or hint towards various potential issues. Assumptions Net Sales = Direct Income Credit Sales = Direct Income Credit Purchases = Direct Expense Share Holder Fund (SHF) = Total Asset - Total_Liability Net Profit After Income & Taxes(NPAIT) = Total Income - Total Expense Types of Ratios: 2.7.1 Liquidity Ratios Consists of: 2.7.1.1 Current Ratio = Current Assets/Current Liability 2.7.1.2 Quick Ratio = Quick Assets/Quick Liability Requires 2 types of accounts: Current Asset(e.g) 2. Current Liability(e.g) As soon as you will set your account types for the relevant account in your “Chart of Accounts”, both Current Ratio and Quick Ratio will show the correct value. 2.7.2 Debt Equity Ratios Consists of: 2.7.2.1 Debt Equity Ratio = Total Liability / SHF 2.7.2.2 Gross Profit Ratio = (Net Sales - COGS)/Net Sales 2.7.2.3 Net Profit Ratio = NPAIT /Net Sales 2.7.2.4 Return on Asset Ratio = NPAIT/Total Assets 2.7.2.5 Return on Equity Ratio = NPAIT/SHF For Gross Profit Ratio and Net Profit Ratio to show the correct data we need to add the relevant account type to “Direct Income” (as direct income is treated as Net Sales). (e.g.) 2.7.3 Turnover Ratios Consists of: 2.7.3.1 Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = COGS/ Avg. Stock 2.7.3.2 Debtor Turnover Ratio = Credit Sales / Avg. Debtors 2.7.3.3 Creditor Turnover Ratio = Credit Purchases / Avg. Purchases 2.7.3.4 Inventory Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Total Assets Average of Stock / Debtors / Purchases is calculated by ⇒ (opening of first year + closing of last year) / 2 3. Taxes 3.1 Sales and Purchase Register Go to: Accounts > Taxes > Sales Register or Purchase Register. The Sales and Purchase Register report shows all the Sales and Purchase transactions for a given period with invoiced amount and tax details. In this report, each taxes has a separate column, so you can easily get total taxes collected / paid for a period for each individual tax type, which helps to pay the taxes to government. 4. Budget and Cost Center 4.1 Budget Variance Go to: Accounts > Budget and Cost Center > Budget Variance Report. In OMEX, you can assign expense budget for an expense account against any specific cost center. This report gives a comparison between budgeted and actual expenses and the variance (the difference between the two) in monthly / quarterly / yearly view. 5. Tax reports for India 5.1 GSTR-1 (India) Go to: Accounts > Goods and Services Tax (GST India) > GSTR-1. The GSTR-1 report helps Indian users to file monthly return of outward supplies. This report shows all the sales transactions of the company in Govt specified format. The output of the report is changed based on the selected type of business (B2B, B2C Large, B2C Small, CDNR and Export). 5.2 GSTR-2 (India) Go to: Accounts > Goods and Services Tax (GST India) > GSTR-2. The GSTR-2 report helps Indian users to file monthly return of inward supplies. The report gives the details of all inward supplies of goods or services received during a month, in Govt specified format. 6. Analytics 6.1 Item wise Sales and Purchase Register Go to: Accounts > Analytics > Item-wise Sales Register or Item-wise Purchase Register. The Item Wise Sales and Purchase Register report shows all the Sales and Purchase transactions for a given period with item rate, quantity, amount and tax details. In this report, taxes has a separate column, so you can easily get individual taxes for each individual item. From this report you can have a look of which items are sold or purchase most. More detailed analysis can also be done by using the 'Group By' filter which gives sales data for a specific Customer, Supplier, Territory, etc. You can find out which Item is more popular in which region or which Customer is buying which Item more. 6.2 Sales or Purchase Invoice Trends Go to: Accounts > Analytics > Sales Invoice Trends or Purchase Invoice Trends. Another very useful report is invoice trends, From this report you can easily get the trending items on monthly, quaterly, half yearly or yearly basis. You will get the idea of sales and purchase both in quantity and amount. 7.

Review changes Accounts Receivable and Payable In OMEX's accounting module, accounts receivable and payable play crucial roles in managing a company's finances. Accounts receivable tracks the money owed to the company by its customers for goods or services provided on credit. This feature helps streamline invoicing, payment tracking, and ultimately, cash flow management. Accounts payable monitors the money owed by the company to its suppliers or vendors. It facilitates the management of bills, outgoing payments, and ensures timely settlement to maintain healthy vendor relationships. Both accounts receivable and payable modules in OMEX provide real-time visibility into financial transactions supporting effective decision-making and monitoring of overall financial health of the organisation.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Role and Role Profile A Role defines the permissions for accessing various documents in OMEX. Roles define a set of permissions which can be set from the Roles Permission Manager. Most commonly used roles are already defined in OMEX, you can use the system with them. If needed, you can add more roles. For example, if you assign the Sales User role to a user, they'll be able to access documents like Quotations and Sales Orders since the permissions are already set for the role Sales User. Role profiles store different roles so that multiple roles can be assigned at once. Role Profiles act as a template to store and select multiple roles. This Role Profile can then be assigned to a User. For example, a Sales Supervisor will have the roles Employee, Sales Manager, Sales User, and Sales Master Manager. Role Profiles are useful to assign multiple roles at once when adding multiple employees. To access Role, go to: Home > Users and Permissions > Role 1. How to add a Role Go to the Role list, click on New. Enter a name for the Role. Choose whether the Role has desk access. A role that has desk access can access OMEX modules and the company's documents. The level of access depends on the roles assigned to the user. Save. You can add two factor authentication for the role and also restrict it to a specific domain. From here, you can go to the Roles Permission Manager and set permissions for the role across different DocTypes. 2.

Review changes Cost Center and Budgeting In OMEX, cost centers are crucial for budgeting and financial management. They represent distinct areas or departments within a company where costs are incurred and tracked. By associating expenses with specific cost centers, OMEX provides a granular view of spending patterns and helps in analyzing budget performance. Budgeting in OMEX involves setting financial goals for each cost center based on historical data and projected expenses. This allows businesses to monitor their financial health, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions to achieve their financial objectives effectively.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Data Import The Data Import Tool in OMEX lets you import records from a CSV/Excel file. Data Import Tool is an easy way to upload (or edit) bulk data (especially master data) into the system. To begin importing data, go to: Home > Data Import and Settings > Import Data Or go to the Document you want to import and click on Menu > Import: Before using Data Import ensure that you have all of your data ready. 1. Inserting New Records Let's say you want to import the list of Customers from your old system into OMEX. The first step is to download a template in which we can enter our data. 1.1 Download the Template Go to Customer List, click on Menu > Import. Click on New. Select Import Type as Insert New Records. Click on Save. Now, click on Download Template. While inserting new records, the template should be blank. If you have a few Customers in your system, you can select Export Type as \"5 Records\" to see the format in which you have to enter the data in the template. Select the File Type of the export template. Select the fields that you want to fill in as the Customer details. Click on Export. 1.2 Entering Data in the Template Your downloaded template will look something like this: Open the downloaded template in a spreadsheet application (like Excel, Numbers, or Libre Office) and enter the data below the column headings shown as follows: Now, save your template as an Excel or Comma Separated Values (CSV) file. You can leave the ID column as blank while inserting new records. When you import this template, each row will make a Customer record in the system. 1.3 Importing the Template After updating your template file, go back to the Data Import form and attach the file by clicking on the Attach button. Select the template file and click on Upload. After the upload is successful, click on Start Import. If there are any errors in your template, they will be shown in the Warnings section. The warnings will be categorized by Row or Column with their number so that you can easily track them down in the template and resolve them. You must resolve all the warnings before you can import the data. After you have resolved the warnings, click on Start Import again to import the data. On successful import of the data, you'll see a log of each record that was created in the Import Log section. 2. Updating Existing Records Let's say you want to update Customer data in bulk in your system. The first step is to download the template with the data. 2.1 Download the Template Go to Customer List, click on Menu > Import. Click on New. Select Import Type as Update Existing Records Click on Save. Now, click on Download Template. While updating existing records, you must export the records from the system with the ID field and the fields that you want to update. You can choose All Records or Filtered Records depending on your case. Select the fields that you want to update for the Customer records. Click on Export. 2.2 Updating Data in the Template Your downloaded template will look something like this: Now, change the values in your template and save the file as Excel or CSV. While exporting records for updating them, ensure that the ID column is exported and is untouched. The values in the ID column are used to identify the records in the system. You can update the values in other columns but not in the ID column. If you remove some child table row, the system will consider that the row is supposed to be deleted. 2.3 Importing the Template Follow the steps in Importing the Template section above. 3. Importing Child Records Data in OMEX is stored in tables like a spreadsheet with columns and rows of data. Each form likes Sales Order has multiple fields like Customer, Company, etc. It also has tables like the item table, tax table, etc. In Data Import, the set of fields in the Sales Order are treated as the main table and the rows inside the child table (item table) are treated as the child table for data import. Each form in OMEX can have multiple child tables associated with it. The child tables are linked to the parent tables and are implemented where there are multiple values for any property. For example, an Item can have multiple prices, a Sales Invoice has multiple Items, Taxes, and so on. When you export a document with child tables, for e.g., each child row will appear on a separate row but it is associated with a single parent row. The subsequent values in the parent columns will remain blank. You must ensure that this order is not broken when you are importing them via Data Import. 4. Import Options 4.1 Import from Google Sheets You can also import data from Google Sheets. Import your template in Google Sheets and enter the data. Make sure the Google Sheet is public. You can test this by opening the Google Sheets URL in an incognito browser window. 4.2 Submit After Import In OMEX document types are mainly of two types - masters and transactions. The masters are records like Customer and Task which can only be saved not submitted. Transactions like Sales Orders, Purchase Invoices are submittable documents and can be submitted. When you select a submittable document type for Import, you can tick Submit After Import to submit the document after it is imported. 4.3 Don't Send Emails Let's say you have created a Notification in your system and whenever a Lead is created an email is sent. Now, if you are bulk importing Leads then a lot of emails will be sent, which may not be desired. You can disable this option to avoid sending emails. 5. Additional Notes 5.1 Upload Limit There is no hard limit on the number of records that can be imported. But you must try and upload only a few thousand records at a time. Importing a large number of records (let's say 50,000) might slow down the system considerably for the users that are using the system. 5.2 CSV Files A CSV (Comma Separated Value) file is a data file that you can upload into OMEX to update various data. Any spreadsheet file from popular spreadsheet applications like MS Excel or Open Office Spreadsheet can be saved as a CSV file. If you are using Microsoft Excel and using non-English characters, make sure to save your file encoded as UTF-8. For older versions of Excel, there is no clear way of saving as UTF-8. So save your file as CSV, then open it in Notepad, then save as “UTF-8”. (Or upgrade your Excel!) 6. Video 7.

To access Bulk Update, go to: Home > Settings > Bulk Update Consider that you have 20 quotations in which you had selected 'All Territories' and now you want to change the Territory to France. Instead of updating the individual quotations manually, you can use Bulk Update to update all 20 Quotations at once. To do this, Go to Bulk Update. Select the Document Type, like Quotation. Select the field to update, like territory. Enter a valid new value to be updated. Enter any conditions that apply, for example, status=\"Draft\" will only affect documents in the Draft stage. Select the limit, i.e. number of documents (Quotations) to be updated. Click on Update. Note: You can only update fields that can be updated normally in a particular stage. For example, valid till date cannot be updated for submitted Quotations.

    "title": "Concepts and Terms",
    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Concepts and Terms Before you start implementation, lets get familiar with the terminology that is used and some basic concepts in OMEX. Basic Concepts Company This represents the Company records for which OMEX is setup. With this same setup, you can create multiple Company records, each representing a different legal entity. The accounting for each Company will be different, but they will share the Customer, Supplier and Item records. Setup > Company Customer Represents a customer. A Customer can be an individual or an organization. You can create multiple Contacts and Addresses for each Customer. Selling > Customer Supplier Represents a supplier of goods or services. Your telephone company is a Supplier, so is your raw materials Supplier. Again, a Supplier can be an individual or an organization and has multiple Contacts and Addresses. Buying > Supplier Item A Product, sub-product or Service that is either bought, sold or manufactured and is uniquely identified. Stock > Item Account An Account is a heading under which financial and business transactions are carried on. Examples of accounts are \"Debtors\", \"Creditors\", \"VAT Payable\", “Travel Expenses”, \"Sales\", \"Share Capital\", etc. OMEX keeps track of your customers' and suppliers' balances in the background, so you don't need to create dedicated Accounts for them. Accounting > Chart of Accounts Address An address represents location details of a Customer or Supplier. These can be of different locations such as Head Office, Factory, Warehouse, Shop etc. Selling > Address Contact An individual Contact belongs to a Customer or Supplier or is just an independent. A Contact has a name and contact details like email and phone number. Selling > Contact Communication A list of all Communication with a Contact or Lead. All emails sent from the system are added to the Communication table. Support > Communication Price List A Price List is a place where different rate plans can be stored. It’s a name you give to a set of Item Prices stored under a particular List. Selling > Price List Buying > Price List Accounting Fiscal Year Represents a Financial Year or Accounting Year. You can operate multiple Fiscal Years at the same time. Each Fiscal Year has a start date and an end date and transactions can only be recorded in this period. When you “close” a fiscal year, it's balances are transferred as “opening” balances for the next fiscal year. Setup > Company > Fiscal Year Cost Center A Cost Center is like an Account, but the only difference is that its structure represents your business more closely than Accounts. For example, in your Chart of Accounts, you can separate your expenses by its type (i.e., travel, marketing, etc.). In your Chart of Cost Centers, you can separate them by product line or business group (e.g., online sales, retail sales, etc.). Accounting > Chart of Cost Centers Journal Entry A document that contains General Ledger (GL) entries and the sum of Debits and Credits of those entries is the same. In OMEX you can update Payments, Returns, etc., using Journal Entries. Accounting > Journal Entry Sales Invoice A bill sent to Customers for delivery of Items (goods or services). Accounting > Sales Invoice Purchase Invoice A bill sent by a Supplier for delivery of Items (goods or services). Accounting > Purchase Invoice Currency OMEX allows you to book transactions in multiple currencies. There is only one currency for your book of accounts though. While posting your Invoices with payments in different currencies, the amount is converted to the default currency by the specified conversion rate. Setup > Currency Selling Customer Group A classification of Customers, usually based on market segment. Selling > Setup > Customer Group Lead A person who could be a future source of business. A Lead may generate Opportunities. (from: “may lead to a sale”). CRM > Lead Opportunity A potential sale. (from: “opportunity for a business”). CRM > Opportunity Quotation Customer's request to price an item or service. Selling > Quotation Sales Order A note confirming the terms of delivery and price of an Item (product or service) by the Customer. Deliveries, Work Orders and Invoices are made on basis of Sales Orders. Selling > Sales Order Territory A geographical area classification for sales management. You can set targets for Territories and each sale is linked to a Territory. Selling > Setup > Territory Sales Partner A third party distributer / dealer / affiliate / commission agent who sells the company’s products usually for a commission. Selling > Setup > Sales Partner Sales Person Someone who pitches to the Customer and closes deals. You can set targets for Sales Persons and tag them in transactions. Selling > Setup > Sales Person Buying Purchase Order A contract given to a Supplier to deliver the specified Items at the specified cost, quantity, dates and other terms. Buying > Purchase Order Material Request A request made by a system User, or automatically generated by OMEX based on reorder level or projected quantity in Production Plan for purchasing a set of Items. Buying > Material Request Stock (Inventory) Warehouse A logical Warehouse against which stock entries are made. Stock > Warehouse Stock Entry Material transfer from a Warehouse, to a Warehouse or from one Warehouse to another. Stock > Stock Entry Delivery Note A list of Items with quantities for shipment. A Delivery Note will reduce the stock of Items for the Warehouse from where you ship. A Delivery Note is usually made against a Sales Order. Stock > Delivery Note Purchase Receipt A note stating that a particular set of Items were received from the Supplier, most likely against a Purchase Order. Stock > Purchase Receipt Serial Number A unique number given to a particular unit of an Item. Stock > Serial Number Batch A number given to a group of units of a particular Item that may be purchased or manufactured in a group. Stock > Batch Stock Ledger Entry A unified table for all material movement from one warehouse to another.

Stock > Quality Inspection Item Group A classification of Item. Stock > Setup > Item Group Human Resource Management Employee Record of a person who has been in present or past, in the employment of the company. Human Resources > Employee Leave Application A record of an approved or rejected request for leave.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Fiscal Year A Fiscal Year is used to record and report the transactions for the year. It is also known as a financial year or a budget year. It is used for calculating financial statements in businesses and other organizations. The Fiscal Year may or may not be the same as a calendar year. For tax purposes, companies can choose to be calendar-year taxpayers or fiscal-year taxpayers depending on the jurisdiction. In many jurisdictions, regulatory laws regarding accounting and taxation require such reports once per twelve months. However, it is not mandatory that the period should be a calendar year (that is, 1 January to 31 December). A Fiscal Year usually starts at the beginning of a quarter, such as April 1, July 1 or October 1. However, most companies' Fiscal Year also coincides with the calendar year, which starts at January 1. For the most part, it is simpler and easier that way. For some organizations, there are advantages in starting the Fiscal Year at a different time. For example, businesses that are seasonal might start their Fiscal Year on July 1 or October 1. A business that has most of its income in the fall and most of its expenses in the spring might also choose to start its Fiscal Year on October 1. That way, they know what their income will be for that year, and can adjust their expenses to maintain their desired profit margins.

To set the Fiscal Year as default, click on the Set as Default button. In case you have multiple companies sharing the same Fiscal Year, you can add it as shown in the following screenshot: Note - 1.New Fiscal Year should be created each year, at the end of the current fiscal year. Creation of new Fiscal Year before its begining has been automated in OMEX. 2.Three days prior to the end of the current Fiscal Year, system checks if new Fiscal Year for the incoming year is already created.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Auto Repeat Auto Repeat feature helps you create certain documents automatically in a given time period. From version 12, you can Customize any Form to make the documents repeatable. For Example: Assuming that you follow deferred expense system for some items. It requires you to create same Journal Entry every month to credit Deferred Expense account and debit Expense Account. You can create first Journal Entry manually for it, and then create auto-repeat transaction for it. To access Auto Repeat, go to: Home > Settings > Automation > Auto Repeat 1. How to set up Auto Repeat 1.1 Customize the Form Go to: Home > Customization > Form Customization > Customize Form. Select the form in which you want to allow creation of repeatable documents. Check 'Allow Auto Repeat' to allow the creation of repeatable documents for that Form. This is necessary for the document type to show up in the Reference Document field under the Auto Repeat doctype. 1.2 Set up Auto Repeat Go to Home > Settings > Automation > Auto Repeat > New. Select the Reference Document Type, like Journal Entry or Sales Invoice, etc. Select the Reference Document. This is the individual document that you want to repeat. Set the Start Date and End Date (optional). If End Date is not specified, recurring documents will be created, unless the Auto Repeat is disabled. Set the Frequency for creating repeatable documents (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Half-yearly, Yearly). Save. 1.3 Set up Auto Repeat directly from the document You can also set a document on Auto Repeat by clicking the Repeat option from the Menu in the Toolbar. Note: If a document is already on Auto Repeat, the Repeat option is not available. Once you click on Repeat, a prompt for Auto Repeat will show up. Fill in the details and click on Save. 2. Features 2.1 Submit on Creation If the reference document type is submittable, you get an option called _Submit on Creation_. If this is checked, your document will be submitted on creation. 2.2 Notify by Email If you want to notify certain contacts whenever the recurring documents are created, you can check 'Notify by Email' in the Notification section of Auto Repeat. This will send the auto-generated recurring documents to the specified Email Addresses. Fields for the same are explained below: Recipients: Defines the Email IDs of the recipients for recurring document creation emails. Get Contacts: This button will fetch the contacts linked to the document that is set on Auto Repeat and fill up the Recipients field with the same. Template: You can choose an Email Template for the email. This will fill up the Subject and Message fields as well. Subject: Subject for your Email (example: Recurring ToDo created successfully). Message: Message to be sent in the Email. Preview Message: This button will show a preview of the message. Print Format: Select a print format to define document view which should be emailed to customer. Note: If the document you are setting up Auto Repeat for, is submittable, ensure that \"Allow Print for Draft\" is enabled in Print Settings to receive the new recurring document in Auto Repeat Notification Email. If this is not enabled, you will be notified about the recurring document creation without the document. 2.3 Repeat on a particular day If the frequency is set as Monthly, Quarterly, Half-yearly or Yearly, then it will create recurring documents in the respective months on the same day as the 'Start Date' of Auto Repeat. If you want to create recurring documents on some other day then you can set one of the following: Repeat on Day: Day of the month on which recurring document will be created. For example, if frequency is Monthly and you enter 7 then it will generate recurring document on 7th of the respective month. Repeat on Last Day of the Month: This option is available as the last day of every month is different. For example, in a leap year last day of Feb is 29th, and it is 28th otherwise. If you check this option, it will create recurring documents on the last day of the respective months. 2.4 Ability to select weekdays for Auto Repeat Introduced in version 13 Auto Repeat with Weekly frequency allows you to select the days on which you want the recurring documents to be created. 2.5 Dashboard You can see the Auto Repeat schedule in the Dashboard of Auto Repeat document. If you don't specify the End Date then the schedule will show only the Next Schedule Date. 2.6 Auto Repeat Frequency on the sidebar When a document is set on Auto Repeat you can see the Auto Repeat frequency on the sidebar. You can click on the status to see the linked Auto Repeat document. 2.7 Disable Auto Repeat If you check this field it will stop creating recurring documents and unlink the Auto Repeat document from the Reference Document.

It allows you to create your own Chart of Accounts according to your requirement and import it into the system. Any existing Chart Of Accounts against that company will be overwritten. Make sure the company you are selecting doesn't have any pre-existing transactions otherwise you'll receive a validation error.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Capacity Planning Capacity planning is the process in which an organization decides whether or not to accept the new orders based on the resources and existing work orders. Capacity planning has been enabled by default in your account, to know more go to: Home > Manufacturing > Settings > Manufacturing Settings 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Work Order, it is advised that you create the following first: Bill Of Materials Operation Workstation Work Order 2. How Capacity Planning Works in OMEX The user has to define the number of days in the \"Capacity Planning For\" field under manufacturing settings to plan the upcoming work orders. For example, if you have kept the Capacity Planning For 30 days and to make 1 finished good it requires 5 days then on the current date user can only accept the 6 work orders (30/5 = 6). You can take the next Work Order when your Workstation gets free. 2.1 Create Work Order With Operations User needs to create the Work Orders with Operations so that the system will track the Job Card timings against the Work Order. Once the user submits the Work Order, system will generate the Job Card with the available Workstation's time details. If 'Allow Overtime' is disabled in Manufacturing Settings then the system schedules the job as per the timings defined in the Workstation. If \"Allow Production on Holidays\" is disabled then the system schedules job only on working days. 2.2 Workstation's Production Capacity In the Workstation, the user can set the 'Production Capacity'. This is the number of Operations the system will allow you work on in this Workstation. For example, if a certain Workstation can handle 10 operations at the same time, enter the 'Production Capacity' as 10. 2.3 Job Card With Timing The system will auto-create the Job Card with timing against each operation based upon the time required to complete that operation and Workstation's availability. The user has to set the planned start date and based on the operation time, system calculates the planned end date. 2.4 Work Order Planned Start Date and End Date Based on the planned start date and end date, users can calculate the capacity of their work stations. Also, they can track the status of the work order using the Calendar. To view calendar, goto: Work Order List > Calendar > Default 2.5 Capacity Planning Error If the Production Capacity days is less than time required to complete the operation then system throws a capacity planning error. In this case, user has to increase the number under \"Production Capacity\" days in the Manufacturing Settings or reduce the number of finished goods as per the capacity of the Workstations Capacity Planning administrator edited 6 months ago × No Revisions Previous Next Page Settings × Route omex/ Hide on Sidebar Update Preview Discard Save Toggle Dropdown Draft Title Content Title Enter title for the new Wiki Group Submit Was this article helpful?

For example, if you have kept the Capacity Planning For 30 days and to make 1 finished good it requires 5 days then on the current date user can only accept the 6 work orders (30/5 = 6). You can take the next Work Order when your Workstation gets free.",
      "2.1 Create Work Order With Operations": "User needs to create the Work Orders with Operations so that the system will track the Job Card timings against the Work Order. Once the user submits the Work Order, system will generate the Job Card with the available Workstation's time details. If 'Allow Overtime' is disabled in Manufacturing Settings then the system schedules the job as per the timings defined in the Workstation. If \"Allow Production on Holidays\" is disabled then the system schedules job only on working days.",
      "2.2 Workstation's Production Capacity": "In the Workstation, the user can set the 'Production Capacity'. This is the number of Operations the system will allow you work on in this Workstation. For example, if a certain Workstation can handle 10 operations at the same time, enter the 'Production Capacity' as 10.",
      "2.3 Job Card With Timing": "The system will auto-create the Job Card with timing against each operation based upon the time required to complete that operation and Workstation's availability. The user has to set the planned start date and based on the operation time, system calculates the planned end date.",
      "2.4 Work Order Planned Start Date and End Date": "Based on the planned start date and end date, users can calculate the capacity of their work stations. Also, they can track the status of the work order using the Calendar. To view calendar, goto: Work Order List > Calendar > Default",
      "2.5 Capacity Planning Error": "If the Production Capacity days is less than time required to complete the operation then system throws a capacity planning error. In this case, user has to increase the number under \"Production Capacity\" days in the Manufacturing Settings or reduce the number of finished goods as per the capacity of the Workstations Capacity Planning\n\nadministrator edited 6 months ago\n\n\n×\n\n\n\n\nNo Revisions\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext Capacity Planning\n\nadministrator edited 6 months ago\n\n\n×\n\n\n\n\nNo Revisions\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext Capacity Planning\n\nadministrator edited 6 months ago\n\n\n×\n\n\n\n\nNo Revisions\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext Capacity Planning\n\nadministrator edited 6 months ago\n\n\n× Capacity Planning\n\nadministrator edited 6 months ago",

Review changes Workflow State A 'Workflow State' is a specific status that a document (such as a sales order, purchase order, or leave application) can be in during its lifecycle. Workflow states are crucial for managing multi stage approval processes, ensuring proper checks and balances, and maintaining the flow of operations. Different Workflow States may be achieved before or after applying different Workflow Actions on them. If you want to create a Workflow where there are multiple approvals from manager, senior manager, general manager, etc, you can set the states for it from Workflow States. The system represents different states in different colours based on the Style tagged to each stage.

Review changes Basics of Manufacturing OMEX comes batteries included for all requirements of a manufacturing business like maintaining Warehouses, Workstation / Machine, Operations, Finished Goods, Raw Materials, Bill of Materials tracking, Work Order planning and execution, procurement, and a lot more. 1. Master Data The Manufacturing module in OMEX helps you to maintain Warehouses(location), Workstations, Operations, Finished Goods, and Raw Materials. For manufacturing Operations and their respective Workstations are important, which can be configured based on the Finished Goods in the Bill of Materials. Warehouses are useful to store the Raw Materials and the Finished Goods. In OMEX, users can create separate Warehouse to keep Raw Materials, and Finished Goods. More details are as below: Warehouse Workstation / Machine Operation Raw Material / Finished Good Routing 2. Transaction Data The Manufacturing module in OMEX helps you to maintain a multilevel Bill of Materials (BOMs) for your Items. It helps in product costing, production planning, creating work orders for your manufacturing shop floors, creating job cards, and planning inventory by getting your material requirements via BOMs (also called Material Requirements Planning or MRP). More details are as below: Bill Of Materials Work Order Job Card Disassembly Order Production Plan 3. Types of Production Planning Broadly, there are three types of Production Planning Systems: Make to Stock: In these systems, production is planned based on a forecast and the Items are then sold to distributors or customers. All fast-moving consumer goods that are sold in retail shops like soaps, packaged water, etc. and electronics like phones are made to stock. Make to Order: In these systems, items are manufactured only after the customer places an order of a certain number according to the customer's requirement. For example, a wedding cake. Engineer to Order: In this case, each sale is a separate project and has to be designed and engineered to the requirements of the customer. Common examples of this are any custom business-like furniture, machine tools, specialty devices, metal fabrication, etc. Most small and medium-sized manufacturing businesses are based on a make to order or engineer to order system and so is OMEX. For engineer to order systems, the Manufacturing module should be used along with the Project module. 4. Manufacturing impact on Inventory Work order status is dependent upon the stock transactions made against it. In OMEX, you can transfer the raw materials required to make finished goods from Store to Work In Progress Warehouse. From Work-In-Progress warehouse the raw materials can be consumed using the Stock Entry. You get the option to either bulk consume the raw materials and add the finished good or consumed the materials first and then add the finished good. 5. OMEX Manufacturing Demo Check out the following video to know about features in the manufacturing module.

Review changes Delete Company Transactions OMEX allows you to delete all the transactions like Sales Invoices, Sales Order, Payment Entries etc associated with a company, while keeping the master data intact.

    "title": "Role Based Permissions",
    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Role Based Permissions Permission to different documents can be controlled using Role Based Permissions. OMEX has a role-based permission system. It means that you can assign Roles to Users, and Permissions can be set on Roles. The Role Permissions Manager allows you to set which roles can access which documents and with what permissions (read, write, submit, etc.). Once roles are assigned to a user, their access can be limited to specific documents. The permission structure allows you to define different permission rules for different fields using a concept called Permission Level of a field. 1. How to use the Role Permissions Manager To start using the Role Permission Manager, go to: > Home > Users and Permissions > Role Permissions Manager Permissions are applied on a combination of: Roles: As we saw earlier, Users are assigned Roles and it is on these Roles that permission rules are applied. For example, a sales user may be given the roles of an Employee and a Sales User. Examples of Roles include Accounts Manager, Employee, HR User, etc. * Document Types: Each type of document, master or transaction, has a separate list of role-based permissions as seen in the preceding screenshot. Examples of Document Types are Sales Invoice, Leave Application, Stock Entry, etc. * Permission Levels: In each document, you can group fields by \"levels\". Each group of fields is denoted by a unique number (0 to 9). A separate set of permission rules can be applied to each field group. By default, all fields are of level 0. Permission \"Level\" connects fields with level X to a permission rule with level X.

A role can be permitted to Print, Email, Import or Export data, access Reports, or define User Permissions. * User Permissions: Using User Permissions in OMEX a user can be restricted to access only specific Documents for that Document Type. Eg: Only one Territory from all Territories. User Permissions defined for other Document Types also get applied if they are related to the current Document Type through Link Fields. For example, a Customer is a link field in a Sales Order or Quotation. In the Role Permissions Manager, User Permissions can be set using the 'Set User Permissions' button. To set User Permissions based on documents/fields go to: > Home > Users and Permissions > Permissions > User Permissions * Add a New Rule: In the Role Permissions Manager, to add a new rule, click on the Add a New Rule button and a pop-up box will ask you to select a Role and a Permission Level. Once you select this and click on 'Add', this will add a new row to your rules table. 2. How Role Based Permissions Work Leave Application is a good example that encompasses all areas of a Permission System. It should be created by an Employee. For this, Employee Role should be given Read, Write, Create permissions. * An Employee should only be able to access his/her Leave Application. Hence, User Permissions record should be created for each User-Employee combination. * If you want an Employee to only select a document in another document and not have read access to that document as a whole, then grant only Select perm to the role, Employee. * HR Manager should be able to see all Leave Applications. Create a Permission Rule for HR Manager at Level 0, with Read permissions. Apply User Permissions should be disabled. * Leave Approver should be able to see and update Leave Applications of employees under him/her. Leave Approver is given Read and Write access at Level 0. Relevant Employee Documents should be enlisted in the User Permissions of Leave Approvers. (This effort is reduced for Leave Approvers mentioned in Employee Documents, by programmatically creating User Permission records). * It should be Approved/Rejected only by HR User or Leave Approver. The Status field of a Leave Application is set at Level 1. HR User and Leave Approver are given Read and Write permissions for Level 0, while everyone else (All) are given Read permission for Level 1. * HR User should be able to delegate Leave Applications to his/her subordinates. HR User is given the right to Set User Permissions. A User with HR User role would be able to define User Permissions on Leave Application for other users.

      "1. How to use the Role Permissions Manager": "To start using the Role Permission Manager, go to: > Home > Users and Permissions > Role Permissions Manager Permissions are applied on a combination of: Roles: As we saw earlier, Users are assigned Roles and it is on these Roles that permission rules are applied. For example, a sales user may be given the roles of an Employee and a Sales User. Examples of Roles include Accounts Manager, Employee, HR User, etc.\n* Document Types: Each type of document, master or transaction, has a separate list of role-based permissions as seen in the preceding screenshot. Examples of Document Types are Sales Invoice, Leave Application, Stock Entry, etc.\n* Permission Levels: In each document, you can group fields by \"levels\". Each group of fields is denoted by a unique number (0 to 9). A separate set of permission rules can be applied to each field group. By default, all fields are of level 0. Permission \"Level\" connects fields with level X to a permission rule with level X.

A role can be permitted to Print, Email, Import or Export data, access Reports, or define User Permissions.\n* User Permissions: Using User Permissions in OMEX a user can be restricted to access only specific Documents for that Document Type.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Accounting Dimensions Introduced in Version 12 Dimensional accounting means tagging each transaction with appropriate dimensions like Branch, Business Unit, etc. This allows you to maintain each segment separately, thereby limiting the overall maintenance on GL accounts and your Chart of Accounts remains pure. Cost Center and Project are treated as dimensions by default in OMEX. On setting a field in Accounting Dimension, that field will be added in transactions reports where applicable. In OMEX you can create configurable accounting dimensions and use them in transactions and reports. To access the Accounting Dimension list, go to: Home > Accounting > Settings > Accounting Dimensions 1. How to create Accounting Dimension in OMEX. Go to the Accounting Dimension list and click on New. Select the Reference Document which you want to use as a custom dimension. For example, if you select Department as Reference Document, the dimension will be based on Department. Enter the name of the dimension (This name will appear in the transactions for which dimensions are created). Inside the Dimension Defaults table you can mention company specific default dimensions as shown in the screenshot below. This dimension will be automatically fetched in the transaction against that specific company. Check \"Mandatory\" checkbox if you want the dimension to be mandatory in the transactions. 2. Features As you create the dimension, custom fields will be created using a background job for that specific dimension. You can see them in Accounting Dimensions section inside the transactions which have an impact on Accounting entries (GL Entry). 2.1 Using dimensions in transactions To tag a transaction with a dimension you can select the specific dimension in Accounting Dimensions section as shown in the screenshot below. 2.2 Filtering Reports based on dimensions You can also filter various financial reports like Profit and Loss Statement, Balance Sheet, General Ledger based on these dimensions. 2.3 Making accounting dimensions mandatory for \"Profit and Loss\" and \"Balance Sheet\" Accounts Profit and Loss is the group of Income and Expense accounts that represent your accounting transactions over a period. The Balance Sheet accounts are Application of Funds (Assets) and Sources of Funds (Liabilities) that signify the net-worth of your company at any given time. By selecting the check boxes 'Mandatory for Profit and Loss Account' or 'Mandatory for Balance Sheet' you can configure your dimensions to be mandatory for 'Profit and Loss' and 'Balance Sheet Accounts'. 2.4 Disabling accounting dimensions when no longer required You can also disable the dimensions if you don't require them anymore. The old transactions having accounting dimensions will remain intact.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Common Party Accounting Common Party Accounting in OMEX involves accounting of unusual transactions like creating a Sales Invoice against a primary Supplier. Let's assume an OMEX user who has been making Purchase Invoices against a Supplier, wants to make a Sales Invoice against the same supplier and adjust this Sales Invoice against one of the previous purchases. The above can be achieved by enabling Common Party Accounting. Steps: Go to Accounts Settings and enable Common Party Accounting. Create a link between two parties If the primary role of the party is Supplier, then go to the Supplier Master and Click on Actions -> Link with Customer If the primary role of the party is Customer, then go to the Customer Master and Click on Actions -> Link with Supplier Create a Sales Invoice against the Customer that was set as Secondary Party in the 2nd step. On submitting the Sales Invoice, a Journal Entry will be posted automatically that will create an advance balance against the linked Supplier. 5. Now this Journal Entry advance can be then used to reconcile against a Purchase Invoice.

Review changes Subscription If you offer a service that requires renewal in a certain time period or you pay some monthly expenses like rent (yearly, monthly, quarterly, etc.), you can use the Subscription feature in OMEX to track them. The Subscription master captures all the details required for the auto-creation of Sales or Purchase Invoices. Let's consider a use-case of OMEX subscription itself. Our hosting plans are available on a yearly basis. Each Customer's account has a subscription expiry date, after which customers must renew their subscription with us. To manage the client's subscription expiry and auto-generation of Sales Invoice for the renewal, we use the Subscription feature. To access the Subscription list, go to: Home > Accounting > Subscription Management > Subscription 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Subscription, it is advisable to create the following first: Subscription Plan 2. How to set a Subscription Go to the Subscription list and click on New. Select Party Type as 'Customer' or 'Supplier' and select the party. Set the Start Date from when the subscription will be active. Optionally you can also enter the subscription end date if you know it before hand. Days Until Due is the number of days within which Customer has to pay a generated Sales Invoice. Select the Subscription Plans. Save. Based on the subscription start and end date, actual dates for invoices will be calculated. 3. Features 3.1 Trial Period If you're offering a trial period for the subscription, a Trial Period Start Date and a Trial Period End Date can be set. Invoices will not be generated during the trial period and the Subscription status will show 'Trialling'. 3.2 Cancel Auto Renewal On enabling the 'Cancel At End Of Period' the Subscription will be canceled at the end of its period. For example, if it is a yearly subscription, the system will stop generating invoices after one year of subscription. 3.3 Taxes You can apply Taxes to a Subscription by using a Sales Taxes and Charges Template. Visit the Sales Taxes and Charges Template page to know more. 3.4 Applying discounts You can apply additional discounts on the Subscription based on Grand Total (pre tax) or Net Total (post tax). A discount percentage can also be set. For example, a discount of 2% on 12,000 would be 240 in discount. Visit the Applying Discount page for more details. 3.5 Automatically create invoices Based on the Subscription Plans interval, invoices will be created automatically. \"Generate Invoice At Beginning Of Period\" needs to be enabled if you want to generate invoices as soon as the subscription is active. If \"Generate New Invoices Past Due Date\" is enabled then new invoices will keep on generating even though current invoice is unpaid or past due date. If \"Generate Invoice Early\" is enabled, an invoice will be generated before the end of the period by the number of days entered in \"Generate Invoice Days Early.\" The generated invoices will be submitted automatically by default. If 'Submit Invoice Automatically' is disabled, the invoice will be saved as a draft. 3.6 Follow Calendar Months If 'Follow Calendar Months' is enabled then proper calendar months will be followed even if the Subscription Start Date is in the middle of the month. For Eg: Suppose billing interval is 'Month' and billing interval count is 3 in subscription plan and Subscription Start Date is '15-04-2020' then if 'Follow Calendar Months' is checked then first invoice will be generated for '15-04-2020' to '30-06-2020' rather than '15-04-2020' to '14-07-2020' 3.7 Canceling a Subscription If the Customer decides to cancel a Subscription, it can be canceled in the system using the Cancel Subscription. The system will stop generating invoices when a Subscription is canceled. 3.8 Updating a Subscription Clicking on the Fetch Subscription Updates button will update the Subscription with the latest generated invoices. 4. Difference Between Subscription and Auto-Repeat Auto Repeat Subscription Is applicable on transactions Is applicable on Items Multiple transactions like Sales Order, Purchase Order, Invoices, Journal Entry, etc. are auto created Only Sales Invoices and Purchase Invoices are auto-created Has only a few controls Has many control options to define trials, billing due date, and creating Subscription Plans 5.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Tax Category A Tax Category allows applying one or more Tax Rules to transactions based on various criteria. If you want to apply different kinds of taxes based on Tax Categories, create Tax Categories from: Home > Accounting > Taxes > Tax Category 1. Prerequisites Before creating and using a Tax Category, it is advised to create the following first: Tax Rule 2. How does a Tax Category work Creating a Tax Category is simple, go to the Tax Category list, click on New and enter a name. A Tax category can be linked to one or more Tax Rules. This Tax Category can be assigned to a Customer, so when that Customer is selected, the Tax Category will be fetched. This also applies in case of a Supplier. This will fetch the Sales Tax Template linked to the Tax Rule. Hence, the rows in the Tax table will be automatically filled. Tax Category can be used to group Customers to whom same tax will be applied. For example, Government, NGO, commercial, etc. Tip: One Tax Category can be assigned to multiple Tax Rules. So you can create different combinations to apply taxes automatically to transactions. 3. Assigning Tax Category Tax Category is automatically determined in a transaction by either the Party Address or Party Master (Customer/Supplier). You can assign Tax Category based on: Customer Supplier Address Billing or Shipping. You can select whether Billing Address or Shipping Address gets preference by changing the 'Determine Address Tax Category From' option in Accounts Settings. Tax Category is determined from Party Address first. If the Address is not assigned any Tax Category, then the Party's Tax Category is used. Item You can also manually select the Tax Category in a transaction. 4. What effect does the Tax Category have in a transaction? Specific Item Tax Templates for that Tax Category are automatically set for items. You can create Tax Rules to automatically set a specific Sales / Purchase Taxes and Charges Template based on different Tax Categories in transactions. 5.

    "text": "This space has {{ pending_patches_count }} change(s) pending for review. Review changes Implementation Strategy Implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system such as OMEX is a critical endeavor that can transform the way your organization operates, streamlining processes, enhancing productivity, and fostering growth. To ensure the seamless integration of OMEX into your enterprise, it's imperative to devise a comprehensive implementation strategy. While OMEX offers a user-friendly interface and extensive documentation, engaging a certified implementation partner can significantly enhance your chances of a successful deployment. The Implementation Strategy for Enterprises While OMEX provides comprehensive documentation and resources for self-implementation, enterprise-wide deployments often involve intricate processes and configurations that may go beyond the scope of standard documentation. To create a robust implementation strategy that ensures the success of your OMEX deployment, consider the following steps: Needs Assessment: Work closely with your chosen certified implementation partner to thoroughly assess your organization's needs and challenges. Identify key pain points, process bottlenecks, and strategic goals that the ERP system should address. Customization and Configuration: Leverage the expertise of your implementation partner to customize and configure OMEX according to your business requirements. This includes mapping existing workflows onto the new system and designing user interfaces that enhance user experience. Data Migration and Integration: Collaborate with your partner to plan and execute a seamless data migration from your legacy systems to OMEX. Ensure that integration with other systems is thoroughly tested to maintain data integrity. Change Management and Training: Engage your certified partner to develop a comprehensive change management strategy. They can help you train your employees to use the new system effectively, minimizing resistance to change. Testing and Quality Assurance: Work closely with your partner to conduct thorough testing of the OMEX implementation. Identify and rectify any issues before rolling out the system to the entire organization. Go-Live and Post-Implementation Support: With the assistance of your implementation partner, execute a controlled go-live process. Post-implementation, your partner should provide ongoing support to ensure the system's stability and optimal performance. The Role of an Implementation Partner An implementation partner is a certified professional or firm with in-depth knowledge of OMEX's functionalities, deployment practices, and industry best practices. Collaborating with an experienced implementation partner can bring numerous benefits to your ERP implementation journey: Expertise and Experience: Certified implementation partners possess the expertise and experience necessary to understand your organization's unique needs and tailor OMEX accordingly. Their insights into industry-specific challenges, coupled with their knowledge of OMEX's capabilities, enable them to design solutions that align with your business objectives. Efficient Project Management: An experienced partner can streamline the implementation process, defining clear milestones, timelines, and objectives. Their project management skills ensure that the implementation stays on track, reducing the risk of delays and cost overruns. Customization and Integration: OMEX is a versatile system that can be customized to suit your enterprise's requirements. A certified partner can effectively customize the platform while integrating it with existing systems, ensuring a seamless flow of information across your organization. Training and Change Management: Successful ERP implementation is not just about technology; it's also about managing the organizational change that comes with it. A certified partner can provide comprehensive training to your teams, helping them adapt to the new system smoothly. Ongoing Support: Post-implementation support is crucial for maintaining system functionality and addressing any issues that may arise. A certified partner can offer ongoing support and updates, safeguarding your investment in the long run. Risk Mitigation: ERP implementations can be complex and fraught with challenges. Engaging a certified partner can help mitigate risks by identifying potential issues early and implementing proactive solutions. Before you start managing your Operations in OMEX, you must first become familiar with the system and the terms used. For this, we recommend implementation should happen in two phases. A Test Phase, where you enter dummy records representing your day-to-day transactions, and a Live Phase, where we start entering live data. Test Phase Read the Manual Create a free account at https://omex.com (the easiest way to experiment). Create your first Customer, Supplier and Item. Add a few more so you get familiar with them. Create Customer Groups, Item Groups, Warehouses, Supplier Groups, so that you can classify your Items. Complete a standard sales cycle - Lead > Opportunity > Quotation > Sales Order > Delivery Note > Sales Invoice > Payment (Journal Entry) Complete a standard purchase cycle - Material Request > Purchase Order > Purchase Receipt > Purchase Invoice > Payment (Journal Entry). Complete a manufacturing cycle (if applicable) - BOM > Production Planning Tool > Work Order > Material Issue Replicate a real-life scenario into the system. Create custom fields, print formats, etc as required. Live Phase Once you are familiar with OMEX, start entering your live data! Clean up the account of test data or better, start a fresh install. If you just want to clear your transactions and not your master data like Item, Customer, Supplier, BOM etc, you can click delete the transactions of your Company and start fresh. To do so, open the Company Record via Accounting > Accounting Masters > Company and click on the Manage button, and then the Delete Transaction button. You can also setup a new account at https://omex.com, and use the 14-day free trial. Find out more ways of deploying OMEX Setup all the modules with Customer Groups, Item Groups, Warehouses, BOMs etc. Import Customers, Suppliers, Items, Contacts and Addresses using Data Import Tool. Import opening stock using Stock Reconciliation Tool. Create opening accounting entries via Journal Entry and create outstanding Sales Invoices and Purchase Invoices. If you need help, you can buy support or ask in the user forum.

This includes mapping existing workflows onto the new system and designing user interfaces that enhance user experience.\nData Migration and Integration: Collaborate with your partner to plan and execute a seamless data migration from your legacy systems to OMEX. Ensure that integration with other systems is thoroughly tested to maintain data integrity.\nChange Management and Training: Engage your certified partner to develop a comprehensive change management strategy. They can help you train your employees to use the new system effectively, minimizing resistance to change.\nTesting and Quality Assurance: Work closely with your partner to conduct thorough testing of the OMEX implementation.
